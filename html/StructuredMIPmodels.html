<p>Similarly to what we did in the chapters devoted to pure linear
optimization problems, here we start a group of sections devoted to
specific models and applications. This way from one side we introduce
important applications of mathematical optimization models and their
formulations. On another side we aim at guiding the reader towards
acquiring specific modeling skills. This way we hope that when
modeling a complex real life problem the building blocks introduced in
these chapters will form a rich enough set of modeling tools.</p>

<span id="sect-fixedcharge"></span><h1><span class="section-number">17. </span>The fixed charge problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fixed-charge-problem" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In some applications although it is reasonable to assume the cost
is  linear there might arise a problem of
modeling a discontinuity at zero.
Consider, as an example,  a production problem, like that
already presented in chapter <a class="reference internal" href="LinearModelsWeb.html#structured-linear-optimization-models"><span class="std std-ref">Structured linear optimization models</span></a>.</p>
<p>Production of a particular finished product, sometimes,
involves a cost which is proportional to the quantity to be
produced; this is often associated to labor time or  to the time
spent consuming some of the available resources. But sometimes
a “fixed charge”  is paid at the very start of production.
This cost is a constant which needs to be paid only if the production
level is strictly positive.
As an example, often a machine needs some start-up or set-up time
before being ready to produce. This time, which is non productive, can
be associated to a cost which needs to be paid independently on the
quantity to be produced, provided that this quantity is non zero.
Examples might be  warming up a plant, staff training, or equipment or
tool change
in a machine. We can formally describe the contribution to the total cost
due to the decision to produce <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}\)</span> units of a given  product
as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
C(\var{x}) = \left\{
\begin{array}[c]{ll}
c \var{x} + \param{K} &amp; \text{ if } \var{x}&gt; 0 \cr
0 &amp; \text{ otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}</div><p>This function, if the fixed cost <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{K}\)</span> is non zero, is not continuous,
although it can be proven to be <em>concave</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-0acb9c30dae26548397fd5b50249aca516194408.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p>Through the introduction of an auxiliary
binary variable it is possible to correctly formulate such a  cost function.
Taking into consideration the modeling examples introduced in chapter
<a class="reference internal" href="MIPModels.html#using-binary-variables-in-logical-constraints"><span class="std std-ref">Using binary variables in logical constraints</span></a>
a binary variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span>  is introduced and the
following is required:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} \leq \param{M} \mathvar{\delta}
\end{align*}</div><p>Here <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{M}\)</span> is a sufficiently large constant, e.g., an upper
bound on the production quantity. This way we have formulated, in a
linear way, the logical constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; \leq \param{M} \\
\var{x} &gt; 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta} = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>Thus the indicator variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}\)</span> is forced to 1
when the event <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}&gt; 0\)</span> occurs. This binary variable might then
be used in the objective function to switch on the fixed charge:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min  \sum_j c_j \var{x}_j + \sum_j \param{K}_j \mathvar{\delta}_j  \\
\var{x}_j &amp; \leq \param{M}_j \mathvar{\delta}_j &amp;  \forall \, j \\
\var{x}_j &amp; \geq0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_j &amp; \in \{0,1\} \\
\var{x} &amp;\in X
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> denotes other constraints  of the model.
It is worth observing that this model is not “perfect”:
in fact, while the constraints correctly implement the logical
constraint,
they are not
enough to guarantee that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_j = 0\)</span> then
the corresponding <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_j = 0\)</span>.
Thus, in this model it is possible to obtain feasible
solutions in which although there is no production for a certain
product, nonetheless a fixed charge  is included
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_j = 0,  \mathvar{\delta}_j = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>This modeling error is
irrelevant in this application. In fact, even if it is true that there can
exist feasible solutions with zero production and not null  fixed charge,
thanks to the  minimization of the objective function, these solutions will be
discarded in favor of similar, cheaper, solutions with zero fixed charge.
In other words, although the feasible set is larger then the feasible
set of the original problem, the optimal solutions will be correct,
thanks to the positivity of the fixed charge.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, the role of the indicator variable in the model might be
more complex; it might be involved in different constraints  and
it might  not automatically be driven  to zero when production is null.</p>
<p>In these cases,  an exact formulation of the fixed charge  model would be necessary
and an additional logical constraint would be required:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} = 0 &amp;\implies \mathvar{\delta} = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>As we have already seen, this logical constraint cannot be exactly
translated by means of a
finite number of linear constraints. A
solution, which is only partially satisfactory, consists in transforming the
constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}&gt; 0\)</span> into
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x} \geq \varepsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon&gt; 0\)</span> is a
small enough constant.</p>
<p>In this case it is possible to introduce a
constraint that represents the logical implication</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp;\geq 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta} = 1 &amp; \implies \var{x} \geq \epsilon
\end{align*}</div><p>Choosing the upper bound <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{M}\)</span> requires some
additional care. From a purely logical point of view,   this
constant plays the role of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+ \infty\)</span>;  it is, in other words,
a value large enough  to make the constraint
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x} \leq \param{M}\)</span> redundant.
From the computational point of view the
choice of this constant might have an
influence on the effective possibility
of solving large scale problems in acceptable computational times.
It is important to choose the value of the constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{M}\)</span> in
such a way that, although it should be large enough not to limit in
any way feasible solutions, it must nonetheless be the lowest possible
in order not to generate too weak a relaxation.
In fact, consider a simple example. Assume that in a fixed charge
problem a production variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}\)</span> has an upper bound
equal to, say, 5. Then each of the following logical constraints:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x} &amp; \leq 5 \mathvar{\delta} \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq 10 \mathvar{\delta} \\
\var{x} &amp; \leq 100 \mathvar{\delta}
\end{align*}</div><p>when coupled with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 \leq \var{x} \leq 5, \mathvar{\delta} \in
\{0,1\}\)</span>
produce exactly the
same set of feasible solutions. However, when relaxing the integrality
requirement on the binary variable the resulting polyhedra are
different and, in particular, the first one is stronger, then the
second, which is stronger than the third.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-ae0f07a91c28ed57b57154d795a6679bbc8db4f0.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p>In the figure, the feasible set is represented in green and it
consists of the origin O and the segment (A,B); the relaxed polyhedra
associated to the three formulations above are, respectively, those
with vertices  (O,A,B), (O,A,B,C), (O,A,B,D). (O,A,B** is ideal, as it
is the smallest possible polyhedron including the feasible set.
On the contrary, the other two polyhedra contain vertices which are
not feasible.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">18. </span>Lot sizing<a class="headerlink" href="#lot-sizing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>An immediate application of the fixed charge model can be found in
production planning. The <span class="target" id="index-0"></span>lot sizing problem consists in
deciding production levels (lot sizes) in order to be able to satisfy
a known external demand, taking into account capacity and costs. The
most basic lot sizing model is the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min &amp; \sum_{t=1}^T  (\mathpar{p}_t \var{x}_t + \mathpar{q}_t
\mathvar{\delta}_t + \mathpar{h}_t
\var{s}_t)  \\
\var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t  &amp; = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;t\\
\var{s}_0 = \var{s}_T &amp; = 0 \\
\var{x}_t &amp; \leq  \param{M}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;t\\
\var{x}_t &amp; \geq 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \in \{0,1\} \\
\var{s}_t &amp; \geq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>where (in the following, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> always denotes a time period
within the time horizon):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> is the finite time horizon, i.e., the planning period</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_t\)</span> is the production level at the beginning of
time period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{s}_t\)</span> is the inventory level at the end of the period</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_t\)</span> is the fixed charge binary variable for the
period, used to add a fixed cost whenever the production
in a time period is different from zero</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{d}_t\)</span> is the (known or estimated) demand for the
period</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{p}_t,\mathpar{q}_t, \mathpar{h}_t\)</span> are, respectively,
the unit production cost, the fixed charge, the unit inventory cost</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{M}_t\)</span> is the upper bound required in order to
correctly formulate the fixed charge logical constraint at each
period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Classical lot sizing models are usually analyzed depending on a major
assumption. In many cases the problems are assumed to be
<em>uncapacitated</em>. By this we mean the fact that there is no strict
limit on production capacity in any period, and, similarly, there are
no constraints on inventories. The assumption of no limits on the
production capacity might seem to be contradictory with respect to the
inclusion, in the model, of an upper bound on production, which is
necessary in order to correctly formulate the logical
constraint. However, this upper bound, in uncapacitated models, is
defined as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathpar{M}_t &amp; = \sum_{i=t}^T \mathpar{d}_i
\end{align*}</div><p>This assumption derives from cost considerations: there is in fact no
need to produce, at any time period, more than what will be demanded
in the current and future periods. Any extra production, beyond this
limit, would not be used to satisfy demand and will generate an
additional cost. So, by using this parameter as an upper bound on
production levels, a redundant constraint is generated. To be precise,
the upper bound is redundant for any optimal solution. Using a similar
upper bound does not really limit production: at any time period it is
assumed that production can be set to any reasonable level, without
any strict limitation. It can be easily seen that, thanks to this
upper bound, also the inventory is limited. But, again, this is not a
limited capacity constraint on the inventory, but simply a consequence
of the assumption on the model.</p>
<p>From a purely modeling point of view, including an upper bound on
production or on the inventory would be quite trivial. However it is
known that the  lot-sizing optimization problem is easy to solve
in the uncapacitated case, while it becomes, in general, hard as soon
as strict bounds on production or inventory levels are introduced.</p>
<p>We are not going to go into much detail on the algorithmic aspects of
lot-sizing. It seems worth recalling, however, that the uncapacitated
case remains easily  solvable even when the objective function is
<em>concave</em> in terms of production and inventory levels.</p>
<p>We recall that concave functions are frequently encountered as cost
functions in applied problems. Let us first give some definitions. A
set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S \subseteq \R^n\)</span> is called <span class="target" id="index-1"></span>convex set if</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
x\in S, y \in S \implies \lambda x + (1-\lambda y) \in S,
\forall\, \lambda \in [0,1]
\]</div><p>A convex set is any set characterized by the fact that given any two
elements in the set, also the segment connecting them belongs to the
set.  A <span class="target" id="index-2"></span>convex function over a convex set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> is a
function such that:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) &amp; \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
&amp; \forall\,x,y, \in S, \lambda \in [0,1]
\end{align*}</div><p>while a <span class="target" id="index-3"></span>concave function is any function such that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) &amp; \geq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
&amp; \forall\,x,y, \in S, \lambda \in [0,1]
\end{align*}</div><p>It can be easily seen that for concave functions (here we limit to
functions of a single variable, but a more general result might be
stated)
the following holds:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
f( x + 1) - f(x) &amp; \leq  f(x) - f(x-1)
\end{align*}</div><p>and this means that the <em>increment</em>  in the function is not increasing
with its argument. This situation is very common in industrial cost
functions where there usually is some sort of a scale effect which
makes production, or inventory, display a marginal cost variation
which is non increasing with the quantity. It is some sort of a
quantity discount: one additional unit produced will marginally cost
less as the production level increases.</p>
<p>It is easy to proof that the fixed charge objective function is indeed
a concave function over the set of non negative reals.</p>
<p>A well known result in lot sizing theory is that, provided that the
problem is uncapacitated, if the objective function is a concave
function of the inventory and the production levels, then the optimal
production policy can be efficiently found (i.e., in polynomial
time). We suggest the interested reader to consult the fundamental
book <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="Bibliography.html#id7" title="Yves Pochet and Laurence A. Wolsey. Production planning by mixed integer programming. Springer series in operations research and financial engineering. Springer, New York ; Berlin, 2006.">Pochet and Wolsey, 2006</a>]</span> on this subject. Here it might suffice to say
that there exist many efficient algorithms to optimally solve the
uncapacitated lot sizing problem, the best known of which is the
<span class="target" id="index-4"></span>Wagner-Within algorithm, which is based on dynamic
programming.</p>
<p>It is also important to observe that  the problem is “easy”
and can be efficiently solved for long time horizons even in a much
more general form than the linear one considered here. However, the
formulation given above is far from being ideal and, in general,
solving a  problem of realistic size using  that model with a general
purpose mixed integer linear optimization solver might be extremely
demanding.
We cannot here go into details on strong formulations for this
problem. It is sufficient so say that a strong (ideal) formulation of
the uncapacitated lot sizing problem can indeed be obtained. However,
its formulation requires an exponential number of constraints in the
space of the original variable (although ideal formulations of
polynomial size exist when the problem is reformulated in a higher
dimensional space). Thus,
the direct use of such a formulation for a large scale problem is out
of question. It is nonetheless possible to define a computational
procedure which can be recursively called to sequentially add a small number of
constraints to the original formulation until the optimal solution is
found.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">18.1. </span>Branch and cut - dynamical simplex method<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-and-cut-dynamical-simplex-method" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This kind of procedure is quite common in combinatorial
optimization and it is worth devoting a paragraph to a quick
description.
Assume a formulation of a
problem is given in  which constraints are partitioned into a set of
“easy” constraints, quite limited in number, and another set of
constraints, usually of huge cardinality.</p>
<p>Let us denote these two sets by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_0, F\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min c^T \var{x}  &amp; \\
a_i^T \var{x} &amp; \leq b_i  &amp; i \in F_0 \\
\alpha_i^T \var{x} &amp; \leq \beta_i &amp; i \in F
\end{align*}</div><p>Usually, even if not necessarily,  integrality
requirements for a subset of variables might be present. The idea of the dynamical
simplex method, which is the basis of  the Branch and Cut algorithm, is to start by
solving a relaxation of the problem (possibly a good one) obtained by
eliminating the large family of constraints with index in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> (and, possibly, the integrality requirement too).</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
x^\star_0 &amp; \in \arg \min c^T \var{x}  \\
a_i^T \var{x} &amp; \leq b_i  &amp; i \in F_0
\end{align*}</div><p>The optimal solution of this problem might be a feasible solution or not. If
it is feasible, i.e., if it satisfies also all of the constraints
which have been eliminated, than it is an optimal solution to the
original problem. Otherwise, there must exist at least an inequality,
in family <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>, which is not satisfied by the current
solution.</p>
<p>Assume we have available a procedure, called a <span class="target" id="index-5"></span>separation
procedure which, given a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>certifies that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{x}\)</span> satisfies all of the inequalities
indexed by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>or returns at least an index <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\imath} \in F\)</span> such
that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\alpha_{\bar{\imath}}^T \bar{x} &amp; &gt; \beta_{\bar{\imath}}
\end{align*}</div></li>
</ul>
<p>(and possibly returns many of these indices and, if at all possible,
some of those associated to the “maximally violated” inequalities)</p>
<p>Let us denote this procedure by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(CutGenerator(x,F)\)</span> and
assume it returns a set of indices of violated inequalities, if any
exists, or the empty set if all are satisfied.</p>
<p>Thus a cutting plane algorithm might be built this way:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>let, as before, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0^\star\)</span> be an optimal solution of the initial
relaxed problem</p></li>
<li><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k:= 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_1 = \emptyset\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>While <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C = CutGenerator(x_k^\star,F) \ne \emptyset\)</span>:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k := k+1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_1 = F_1 \cup C\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F = F \setminus C\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>solve:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
x^\star_k &amp; \in \arg \min c^T \var{x}  \\
a_i^T \var{x} &amp; \leq b_i  &amp; i \in F_0  \\
\alpha_i^T \var{x} &amp; \leq \beta_i &amp; i \in F_1
\end{align*}</div></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>End While</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the above algorithmic scheme, the CutGeneration procedure is
repeatedly called to separate the current solution. In fact, all of
the inequalities returned by this procedure are violated in the
current optimal solution. Thus, adding these inequalities to the pool
of current inequalities, will make that solution infeasible. Thus the
procedure, at every iteration, is granted to deliver a different
solution to the current relaxation. It is hoped, and this is what
happens in practice, that the whole algorithm will terminate well
before all of the inequalities of the original set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> have
been added.</p>
<p>This has become the standard way to approach difficult combinatorial
optimization problems. What is needed is, from one side, a family of
valid inequalities, possibly describing the ideal formulation of the
problem or, at least, a subset of the inequalities defining such ideal
representation. This is clearly a modeling problem. From the
algorithmic point of view, it is necessary to have available a
CutGeneration procedure which avoids checking, one by one, all of the
inequalities in search of a violated one or of a proof of
feasibility. This, sometimes, can be done efficiently, while in some
other cases we must be satisfied by an heuristic CutGeneration
procedure, one which is not granted to find a violated inequality even
if one exists. An important result in computational complexity theory
states that an efficient separation procedure exists if and only if an
efficient optimization algorithm exists for the original problem.
In other words, if a problem is efficiently solvable, as it is the
case of the uncapacitated
lot-sizing with linear costs and fixed charge, then there
should exist a formulation and an efficient cut generation algorithm
to solve it through the repeated execution of linear optimization
algorithms.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, if a problem is inherently difficult, as it is
the case, in general, for finite capacity production planning
problems, even if the ideal formulation might be known, finding a
violated inequality or checking they are all satisfied is in general
hard.</p>
<p>This negative result should not however be too much emphasized. Modern
exact optimization procedures do in fact use this kind of strategies,
in order to solve specific instances of hard problems. These are
worst-case results, and they do not prevent single problems to be
solved quite efficiently by using a similar scheme.</p>
<p>This framework is also a justification for presenting linear integer
models for problems, like the lot sizing, for which efficient
algorithms do exist which are somewhat unrelated to linear
optimization.</p>
<p>The reason is the following: if we just needed to solve an
uncapacitated lot sizing problem, it is quite out of question that the
best choice would be to use the Wagner-Within algorithm, or some
other, even more efficient,  available method. However, when trying to
solve more general lot-sizing problems, knowing a set of good quality
inequalities as well as a procedure to separate an infeasible solution
might prove extremely important in the solution of realistic large
size problems.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">18.2. </span>Advanced formulations for the lot sizing model<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-formulations-for-the-lot-sizing-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is not the case to present here the ideal formulation of the lot
sizing model, for which we refer to the relevant literature on the
subject. Introducing this formulation, in fact, would require us to
make a quite long digression on valid inequalities for the problem,
which seems to be out of scope in this notes, mainly devoted to
modeling issues. Another reason for not introducing this formulation
is the fact that, as a consequence of the exponential number of its
constraints, it cannot be used as-is in a model, but included in a
specialized algorithmic procedure of the kind briefly described
above.</p>
<p>It might be worth, however, to introduce a different model for the
problem which is indeed ideal and not too large in dimension. The
model is based on a <em>multi-commodity flow</em> formulation. When a decision
on a production level is taken at a specific time instant, we might
follow the material flow from production up to demand
consumption. This flow usually will be split into some flow of
production going directly to satisfy part of the current demand, and a
set of flows that, passing through a few periods in the inventory,
will eventually contribute to partially satisfy future demand. The
idea of the multi-commodity flow formulation is to make these flows
explicit. We label each production and each inventory variable with
two indices: the current time period, and the time period at which the
material will be delivered to satisfy the demand. Thus, e.g.,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{x}_{3,5}\)</span> represents production in period 3 which will
be used to satisfy (part of)
the demand of period 5; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{s}_{2,6}\)</span> is the quantity of
material in the inventory at the end of period 2 which will be used to
satisfy (part of) the demand of period 6.</p>
<p>The following illustration might be useful to understand the
formulation. Consider the following feasible flow in a 3 period
planning problem:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-1066f385fbf4800402829d2d4927fd82bb8d7306.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>Here, 13 units are produced at time 1, some which to satisfy the
demand of period 1, some for period 2 and 1 for  the
demand of period 3. Another production run is in period 3, in which 6
units are produced to satisfy, with the inventory left over from
previous periods, the demand of period 3.
If we split the single origin/destination flows, we obtain:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-09bceab2b398b257a02531c08c552e5991ae54b1.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>Denoting by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\param{d}_{s,t} = \sum_{p=s}^t \mathpar{d}_s\)</span> the cumulative
demand between periods <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>  and  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, the model can be
written as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min &amp;\sum_{s=1}^T \sum_{t=s}^T (\mathpar{p}_s \var{x}_{st}  + \mathpar{h}_s
\var{s}_{st}) + \sum_{t=1}^T \mathpar{q}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t  \\
\var{s}_{s-1,t} + \var{x}_{s,t}  &amp; =  \var{s}_{st} &amp;
\forall\, &amp;1 \leq s &lt; t \leq T\\
\var{s}_{t-1,t} + \var{x}_{t,t}  &amp; = \mathpar{d}_t &amp;
\forall\, &amp;1 \leq t  \leq T\\
\var{x}_{st} &amp; \leq \param{d}_{t,T} \mathvar{\delta}_s &amp; \forall\, &amp;s
\leq t\\
\var{x}_{st} &amp; \geq 0 \\
\mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \in \{0,1\} \\
\var{s}_{st} &amp; \geq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>The model follows quite closely the standard one, and the link between
the two is obtained by considering the relations</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_i &amp; = \sum_{t=i}^T \var{x}_{it} \\
\var{s}_i &amp; = \sum_{t=i+1}^T \var{s}_{it}
\end{align*}</div><p>In the above model it is assumed that the initial inventory is 0;
in any case, if  the initial inventory is  no more than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{d}_1\)</span> it can  be reduced to  zero,
partially compensating the initial demand. Under the assumption of
zero initial inventory, it is also required to add some border
constraints on the inventory variables associated to the initial
period:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_{0i} &amp; = 0 &amp; \forall\,i &amp; = 1, T
\end{align*}</div><p>and the following one for the impossibility of having a storage “going
back in time” (recall that we used to define the storage at the end of
the period):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_{ii} &amp; = 0  &amp; \forall\,i
\end{align*}</div><p>In the model above, the objective is quite immediately recognized as
perfectly equivalent to the original one.  The first group of
constraints represents the flow of inventories inside the network,
before their exit as partial demand satisfaction. Those constraint
states that the inventory flow of products whose destination is a
future demand either comes from current production or from the
previous period, all with the same destination in the future. The
second group of constraints is associated to demand satisfaction, and
it states that all of the demand of a period needs to be satisfied
with the current production destined to current demand, or with the
products stored in the inventory and destined to satisfy current
demand. No inventory can be left over at this stage.
The following constraint is a set of logical constraints imposing that
at any time period, if there is a non null production, whichever the
destination, then the logical variable of that time period needs to be
set to 1. This variable is then used to add the fixed charge cost to
the objective.</p>
<p>This <em>multi commodity</em> formulation has a larger number of variables
and constraints: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(T^2)\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(T)\)</span> of the
original formulation. However, it can be proven that this formulation
is <em>ideal</em>: relaxing the integrality constraints on the logical
variables, every (optimal) basic feasible solution satisfies also the
binary constraints. Thus it is possible to solve to optimality this
problem  with a single execution of a linear optimization algorithm
like, e.g., the simplex method.  It is worth recalling that, if our
aim was to solve an instance of this problem, even this ideal
formulation might not be a good choice, in particular for large time
horizons. In fact efficient specialized algorithms exist which allow
for a very fast solution even at large size. However, when there are
complicating constraints, like, e.g., finite capacity or additional
logical constraints, it might be useful to add those constraints to a
good formulation, like this one, and to start from this for a branch
and bound algorithm. We recall again, however, that it is possible to
obtain an ideal representation of the problem in the original variable
space, without the necessity of squaring the number of variables and
constraints.</p>

<p>It must be said that modern solvers employ a large set of
preprocessing techniques in order to strengthen the initial
formulation and transform it into one which is as close as reasonably
possible to the ideal one. This is why, employing a state-of-the-art
solver like, in this case, Gurobi, the difference between the two is
not striking. However we can observe that with the original
formulation a step of branch and bound is required, while with the
second  one the simplex method is enough.  The number of simplex
iterations in the second run is much lower than the analogous one in
the first. It must be said, however, that the first formulation has a
much smaller number of variables and constraints, so the real winner
in this case is not so evident. If we tried an older solver like,
e.g., glpsol, then the difference in the two runs would have been very significant.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">18.3. </span>Variants of production planning models<a class="headerlink" href="#variants-of-production-planning-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this part we would like to briefly list some additional modeling
possibilities and some extensions of the basic model, useful in
realistic production scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Backlogs</p>
<p>The first modeling variant we introduce is that related to allowing
for part of the demand not to be satisfied in the period it was
requested. It is possible, sometimes, to delay the delivery of part
of the demand; of course, any delay will involve an additional
cost. In order to model this situation, it is possible to consider
the fact that this is quite symmetrical to the situation of the
inventory. In the case of inventory, in fact, we are producing in
advance with respect to the demand period; and the earlier we
produce, the higher the storage cost will be. This is modeled through an
inventory variable, with a cost, which models the flow of produced
material “towards the future”. In a completely analogous way,
<span class="target" id="index-6"></span>backlog (which is the delayed delivery of products) can be
thought of as an inventory which, from future production periods,
flows “back” towards the satisfaction of a past demand. Every unit
in this backward flow will have an associated backlog cost. Of
course, products never travel back in time, but a backlog can be
used to model production delayed by a few periods. A model with
backlog is the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min &amp; \sum_{t=1}^T  (\mathpar{p}_t \var{x}_t + \mathpar{q}_t
\mathvar{\delta}_t + \mathpar{h}_t
\var{s}_t + \mathpar{b}_t \var{r}_t)  \\
\var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t  + \var{r}_t&amp; = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t +
\var{r}_{t-1}&amp; \forall\, &amp;t\\
\var{s}_0 = \var{s}_T &amp; = 0 \\
\var{x}_t &amp; \leq  \param{M}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;t\\
\mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \in \{0,1\} \\
\var{x}_t, \var{s}_t, \var{r}_t &amp; \geq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>Here we have included a new variable, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{r}_t\)</span> to
represent the quantity of material produced after period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>
which is available either to satisfy the current demand or to go
backward in time to satisfy previous demand.</p>
<p>The following schematic representation should help understanding the
balance equations:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-396e9c6c0afa2a1c233614aef779be3eeeef6f0c.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>The backward arcs in the picture represent the flow of material
produced after the demand period. It is in general assumed that on
the borders of the planning periods, the backlog variable is zero.</p>
<p>This model, similarly to the standard one, can be very easily solved
when there is no strict constraint on finite capacities. Also for
this model there exist alternative formulations, either in a larger
dimensional space, similar to what has been introduced in the
multi-commodity formulation above, or in the same space of variables,
but with an ideal formulation with an exponential number of
constraints.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Startup cost</p>
<p>We have already seen how to model a <em>setup</em> cost which is to be paid
whenever production is positive. A <span class="target" id="index-7"></span>startup cost is
different in that it is a cost to be paid whenever production is
positive after a null production period.  Startup cost, in other
words, is paid whenever production changes its state from zero to
positive. It is quite common in plants with continuous production
and represents a cost to be paid in order to take the production
plant from a quiet state to an active state. On the contrary, setup
costs can be thought of as similar costs, but for a plant which is
always switched off at the end of the period, so that it needs to be
paid at every production period, of course if there is any positive
production.
It is the case, as an example, of
production plants working for 8 hours a day, which, every morning,
need to be set up in order to be able to start production.</p>
<p>A possibility to model startup costs is to introduce an additional
binary variable, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{z}_t\)</span> and to link it in such a way
as to represent this change of state:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=0 \land      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=1  &amp;
\implies \var{z}_t = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>This is equivalent to the logical expression:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=1 \lor  \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=0 \lor
 \var{z}_t = 1
\end{align*}</div><p>which can be formulated as the constraint</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
(1-\mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}) +      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}
+ \var{z}_t  &amp; \geq 1
\end{align*}</div><p>or, simplifying,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{z}_t  &amp; \geq \mathvar{\delta}_{t-1} - \mathvar{\delta}_{t}
\end{align*}</div><p>The opposite implication <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{z}_t = 1 \implies
\mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=0 \land      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=1\)</span> is not
in general required, as the cost associated to the startup variable
will forbid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{z}_t\)</span> to be 1 if there is no startup situation.</p>
<p>It might also be observed that, here, we used
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_t=0\)</span> as an indicator that in that period
production is zero. But, we recall, in the original lot sizing model
this implication was not imposed, as it was automatically true in
optimal solutions, due to a similar reasoning as above: it is costly
to set the variable to 1 when it is not necessary. In this case,
however, some care needs to be taken, as we should consider whether
it is still true that there is no incentive, in optimal solutions,
to have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathvar{\delta}_t=1\)</span> even when production is
zero. And, indeed, now this might happen, in particular when the
startup cost is significantly high: it might be convenient to set
this variable to 1 just to avoid paying a startup cost. This is
incorrect and, in this model, we need to add the requirement:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_t = 0 &amp; \implies \mathvar{\delta}_t = 0
\end{align*}</div><p>which can be approximately formulated as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_t &amp;\geq  \varepsilon \mathvar{\delta}_t
\end{align*}</div></li>
<li><p>Startup time</p>
<p>Another quite frequent effect of startup is that, not only a cost is
incurred, but also production capacity is reduced, due to the time
spent in starting the engine. We report here the example for
startup,  because for setup the situation is easier. In fact, if,
say, one hour of production is lost for setup, we can simply change
the capacity of the production plant, reducing it to take into
account this one hour loss. With startup the situation is different,
as production capacity will be full for every period, except for
those periods which immediately follow a change of state.</p>
<p>Le us assume now that the startup cost model has been included, so that we
can use variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{z}_t\)</span>  to indicate startup
periods. If production capacity is denoted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{C}_t\)</span>
and the loss of production capacity due to startup is denoted by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{ST}_t\)</span>, then the logical constraint linking binary
variables to production can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_t &amp; \leq \mathpar{C}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t - \mathpar{ST}_t \var{z}_t
\end{align*}</div><p>This way, when startup occurs, the upper bound on production is
reduced accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimum production levels</p>
<p>In some production planning cases, when production is active, a
minimum production level might be imposed. Take into account that,
usually, an effect of the presence of setup costs is the fact that
when production is active, production levels are non  negligible, to
compensate for the setup cost. If, nonetheless, a minimum production
level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{LB}_t\)</span> is required, this can be easily introduced  through a linear
inequality:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{x}_t &amp; \geq \mathpar{LB}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t
\end{align*}</div><p>By the way, when present, this lower bound can take the place of the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span> parameter we had to introduce to model some of
the logical constraints in previous sections. If we put together the
maximum and minimum level requirements, the constraint turns out to
be:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\mathpar{LB}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t &amp; \leq \var{x}_t \leq \mathpar{C}_t
\mathvar{\delta}_t
\end{align*}</div><p>from which it is immediately seen that either the production is zero
or otherwise it is within the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([\mathpar{LB}_t, \mathpar{C}_t]\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Safety stock</p>
<p>A similar lower bound is frequently imposed on inventories too, in
order to protect from uncertainties (in the demand, in the
production, …). The difference is that usually a safety stock is
always required, and does not depend on other events or binary
variables. It can thus be trivially imposed via</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_t  &amp; \geq \mathpar{SS}_t
\end{align*}</div></li>
<li><p>Unsatisfied demand.</p>
<p>We have always assumed demand as a quantity to
be delivered exactly, possibly with some delay, as we have seen
before. However, we might as well turn the balance constraint into a
“soft” one by allowing the demand not to be exactly satisfied. Of
course this will imply a penalty in the objective function. The
standard way to soften an equality can be used to obtain equations
like the following one:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t &amp; = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t  -
\var{y}_t \\
\var{y}_t &amp; \geq 0
\end{align*}</div><p>The  non negative variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\var{y}_t\)</span>  subtracted on the
right hand side represents the quantity of available product which
is not used to satisfy the demand or to feed the inventory. If, as
it is required, a positive cost is imposed on this variable in the
objective function, then, if at all possible and convenient, demand will be
satisfied and this variable will be left equal to zero. Otherwise,
either for cost considerations, or in order to cope with
limited production capacity in this and earlier periods, it might be
convenient to use this variable, paying a cost, and avoid full
demand satisfaction. Of course, an upper bound might be imposed to
this variable in order to avoid too large a fraction of the demand
not to be satisfied.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">18.4. </span>Advanced lot sizing models<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-lot-sizing-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will not go too much into details, in this chapter, on generalized
lot sizing models. But we would like to introduce at least a few formulation of realistic
production situations. In fact, real production planning problems
require us to take into account many different aspects, from the
multiplicity of products, to the different production phases, to the
availability of resources. In this part we will define a few such
models, in order to show the power of linear constraints to model even
very complex realistic situations. Of course, modeling is not solving,
and the computational aspects behind the possibility of actually
solving these models are complex and out of scope in this volume. In any case
we would like to recall that  modeling the whole
production planning problem as a single model might be extremely
beneficial, from a cost point of view; typical practical approaches in
this field proceed by decomposing the problem into sub-problems, easier
to solve, but whose interactions are neglected. This usually leads to
far from optimal solutions, and, thus, inefficiencies.
Small scale problems can be solved already from the models we will
introduce here, with general purpose mixed integer linear optimization
tools. Larger scale problems might require advanced algorithmic
implementations, or, possibly, improved formulations.</p>
<section id="master-production-scheduling-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">18.4.1. </span>Master Production Scheduling models<a class="headerlink" href="#master-production-scheduling-models" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><span class="target" id="index-8"></span>MPS (<span class="target" id="index-9"></span>Master Production Scheduling) models consist of a quite
straightforward generalization of lot sizing to take into account</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>limited resource availability</p></li>
<li><p>multiple products</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are two major extensions of the basic model. From one side,
multiple products are considered and their flow through the planning
period must be managed separately one from the other. It actually is
a multi-commodity flow problem. Having different products to consider would not be
a problem if they were completely independent. On the contrary,
dependence among decisions is needed, as, in general, these different
product flows need to access some limited resources. These might be
shared machines, personnel, prime material, budget … In what follows we
formulate  a basic linear model to take into account both multiple
products as well as resources. We consider also some resource
consumption due to setup.</p>
<p>Let:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=1,\ldots,m\)</span> denote the  indices of different products to
be planned simultaneously on the same plant</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k =1, \ldots,K\)</span> denote the set of indices of a set of
resources which are shared among different products. These
resources are available with only finite capacity, so conflicts
arise for their usage, up to capacity</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{L}_t^k\)</span> is the maximum available quantity of
resource <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> during period  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. Depending on the
resource consumption of various products, this amount cannot be
exceeded during any single time period</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{\alpha}^{ik}\)</span>:   the amount of resource <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> which
is necessary in order to produce one unit  of  product <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{\beta}^{ik}\)</span> amount of resource <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>  required for
production setup relative to product  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>. Here it is
assumed that each product type will generate a setup cost when its
production is non zero. Different situations might be dealt with in
quite  a similar way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these parameters, a model might be formulated as follows, where
the superscript on variables denotes each product type:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min &amp;\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{i=1}^m (\mathpar{p}^i_t \var{x}^i_t +
\mathpar{q}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t + \mathpar{h}^i_t \var{s}^i_t)  \\
\var{s}^i_{t-1} + \var{x}^i_t  &amp; = \mathpar{d}^i_t + \var{s}^i_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;i,t\\
\var{x}^i_t &amp; \leq  \mathpar{M}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;i,t\\
\sum_i \mathpar{\alpha}^{ik} \var{x}^i_t + \sum_i \mathpar{\beta}^{ik}
\mathvar{\delta}^i_t &amp; \leq \mathpar{L}^k_t
&amp; \forall\,&amp;t,k\\\var{x} &amp; \in \R^{mn}_{+} \\
\mathvar{\delta} &amp; \in \{0,1\}^{mn} \\
\var{s} &amp; \in \R^{m(n+1)}_{+}
\end{align*}</div><p>The first equation above is the standard inventory balance equation,
the only difference being the fact that it is replicated for each
product type: each product has its own production, inventory,
demand. The following inequalities are the logical constraints which
force the binary variable, for a product in a specific period, to
become 1 when the production of that product in that period is non
zero. Up to now, there was no linking between the different products:
up to here, different products are independent. The following
constraints, however, introduce the dependence: at every time period,
for each of the resources considered, the total amount of resources
consumed cannot be more than the available quantity. Resources are
consumed when production is non zero, and the consumption has been
assumed to be proportional to the quantity produced, with a
proportionality constant which depends on the product type. Moreover,
when there is a non zero production, there might be also a fixed
consumption of a resource due to setup.</p>
<p>A simple example of implementation, along with a small dataset is
reported in what follows:</p>

<p>Running a mixed integer linear optimization algorithm with these data,
the following solution is obtained:</p>

</div><p>From the picture above it is immediate to see that many properties
enjoyed by the standard lot sizing model here are no more valid. In
uncapacitated lot sizing it can be proven that at each period either
there exist a positive production or a positive inventory, but never
both. Here this is no more true.  A consequence of the basic property
of uncapacitated lot sizing is that production is always equal to the
sum of a set of future consecutive demands, which, again, is false in
a model like this one.</p>
<p>For what concerns resource consumption, the situation is the
following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

\end{align*}</div><p>from which it can be seen the both the Machine as well as the
Personnel resource are in some time periods used at maximum capacity.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">18.4.2. </span>Material Requirement Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#material-requirement-planning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The models presented above concern production planning with somewhat
monolithic and independent products. By this we mean that the unique
interaction among different products is due to the scarcity of some
resources, which are needed for different products.</p>
<p>In many situations, however, the situation is highly more
complex. Frequently a product is made through an assembling of several
intermediate products or parts. Sometimes production proceeds in
sequential stages (<span class="target" id="index-10"></span>series production models). In these cases
we might think, for each product, to a graph consisting of a single
path of successive productions, the final product at one stage being
the required material for the following one:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-8715c4d93786bfd9a3c0e2783399e6704029779e.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>To cope with this situation, along with the usual balance constraints
for each (intermediate and final) product, temporal sequences need to
be taken into account, as production at downhill stages cannot be
started until the required production uphill has been completed.</p>
<p>In a more general situation, a final product might be composed of a
more complex set of intermediate products. The following picture
graphically represents a part assembly production model:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-b713fffc280edf73c80062957cd5ded2289efc8a.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>In an even more general situation, the same product or the same
intermediate product might be obtained following different production
paths, and a choice of the most convenient one needs to be
done. Moreover, each product, either final or intermediate, might need
a different quantity of parts from the upper production levels, like
we depict in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><p><img  src="_images/tikz-9700e0e09574b740e0fc57ac68fb60b2b74ec00a.png" alt="Figure made with TikZ" /></p>
</div><p>In a complex situation like those described here we may assume that a
graph <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G=\langle V,E \rangle\)</span> is available to represent the
flow of material and of parts required for the assembly.
Let us denote with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{r}^{ij}\)</span> the number of products of type
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> required as input to product <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>. Let
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{\gamma}^i\)</span>  the <em>lead time</em> for the production of one unit of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>. This is considered as an integer number of time periods
between the start of production and the time by which the part becomes
available.</p>
<p>A possibility for the formulation of this model is the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\min &amp;\sum_{t=1}^T  \sum_{i=1}^m (\mathpar{p}^i_t \var{x}^i_t +
\mathpar{q}^i_t \mathvar{y}\delta^i_t + \mathpar{h}^i_t  \var{s}^i_t)  \\
\var{s}^i_{t-1} + \var{x}^i_{t - \mathpar{\gamma}^i}  &amp; =
\mathpar{d}^i_t +
\sum_{j: (i,j) \in E} \mathpar{r}^{ij}
\var{x}^j_t + \var{s}^i_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;i,t\\
\var{x}^i_t &amp; \leq  \mathpar{M}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t &amp; \forall\, &amp;i,t\\
\sum_i \mathpar{\alpha}^{ik} \var{x}^i_t + \sum_i \mathpar{\beta}^{ik}
\mathvar{\delta}^i_t &amp; \leq \mathpar{L}^k_t
&amp; \forall\,&amp;t,k\\
\var{x}, \var{s} &amp; \geq 0\\
\mathvar{\delta} &amp; \in \{0,1\}^{mn} \\
\end{align*}</div><p>This model, again, inherits many of the basic building blocks of
previously seen models, with some important variations.  In the first
set of equations, we can recognize the basic structure of balance
equations. However, in the left hand side, the set of “ready” products
of type <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> can be seen to be composed either of items in the
inventory at the end of the previous time period, as usual, plus
the quantity of produced items which are available. However, in order
to take into account the lead time, i.e., the time between actual
production start and the availability of the product, the temporal
index is not the actual period, but is shifted backward
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{\gamma}_i\)</span> time units. This way we can take into
account the fact that production is not instantaneous, and, in
particular, production started in a period does not necessarily lead
to a finished product in the same period, ready to satisfy the demand.</p>
<p>On the right hand side, the output side, we have the demand, which is
the real, exogenous, demand for that product at that time period; as
usual, we have the final inventory too. However, now, there is another
important component of the flow out of period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>: this is
composed of all of the material, ready to ship in this period, which
is required as an input in later production stages. The term</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
\sum_{j: (i,j) \in E} \mathpar{r}^{ij}
\var{x}^j_t
\end{align*}</div><p>corresponds to all of the internal requirement for this product. The
sum is extended to all production nodes in the MRP graph which require
parts of type <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> for their assembly. The number of parts
required is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathpar{r}^{ij}\)</span>. This way we model both the
satisfaction of external demand, as well as the demand which arises
from other production stages within the same plant. The main
difference between the two demand types is that while the external
demand may be assumed to be known, or at least, estimated, the
internal demand is part of the decision process itself, and is linked
with all of the other variables of the problem.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a basic building block; it might be generalized in
several ways, taking, e.g., into account some of the extensions we
have seen before.
We might have, e.g., some deadlines, which we might model through a

It is important to recall that solving problems like
this one, while computationally difficult, might be extremely
beneficial in terms of the solution quality.</p>

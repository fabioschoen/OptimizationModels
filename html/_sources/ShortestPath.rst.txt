=====================================
Shortest (Minimum Cost) Path Problems
=====================================

Consider a special case of the minimum cost flow problem in which
 
1. there are two special nodes :math:`s, t`, called
   respectively :index:`source` and :index:`terminal` (or :index:`origin`
   and :index:`destination`)
2. the balance is  :math:`+1`  for the source node,  :math:`-1` for the
   terminal node, zero otherwise
3. the lower bound for the flow  is everywhere 0
4. the upper bound is :math:`\infty` (hence the corresponding constraint
   can be omitted).

This special case is called :index:`minimum cost path` problem and can
be represented as follows:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min_{\var{f}} \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{c}_{ij} \var{f}_{{ij}} \label{eq: sp} \\
   \sum_{(v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{(i, v) \in E} \var{f}_{iv} &
   = \left \{
   \begin{array}[c]{rl}
   +1 & \text{if } v = s \\
   -1 & \text{if } v = t \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{array} 
   \right. & \forall\,v \in V \\ \nonumber
   \var{f}_{ij} & \geq0 \nonumber
   \end{align*}
   

In this minimum cost flow problem
a single  unit of flow starts from the source node and goes to the
destination node.

Based on  the scheme already used, the minimum cost path model can be
represented as follows:

.. role:: model
   :class: smallcaps

:model: Minimum cost path

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   *  :math:`{V}`  nodes of the graph;
   *  :math:`E \subseteq \set{V} \times \set{V}`: set of arcs

   :model:`Parameters:`

   * :math:`\param{s} \in V`: source, or origin;

     are symbolic parameters, not numerical ones.
   * :math:`\param{c}_{ij}`: "cost" associated with one unit of flow
     traversing arc :math:`(i, j) \in E`; it is not necessarily a
     monetary cost: it might be travel time, an index of discomfort or
     of danger, the length, fuel consumption, difficulty, slope, ...

        = \left \{
        \begin{array} {rl}
            1 & \textrm{if } v = \param{s} \\
            -1 & \textrm{if } v = \param{t} \\
            0 & \textrm{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right. \qquad \forall \, v \in V
	\end{align*}
   *  Flow non-negativity:

      .. math::
	 :nowrap:

	 \begin{align*}
         \var{f}_{ij} \geq 0 \qquad \forall \, (i, j) \in E
	 \end{align*}

   Cost minimization:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \[
      \min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{c}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij}
      \]

An example of implementation of the model is given in the following.
We recall however that this model is a  special case of the minimum
cost flow one and thus can be easily solved using the generic
model formulation. It is possible, in other words, to use the generic
minimum cost flow model and simply implement a minimum cost path
instance by suitably defining the problem's data.  Here we report a
possible implementation also in order to show some peculiar aspects of
the modeling language.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The problem of arcs with negative cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before going into more details on this  model and its many
applications it is important  to check whether this model is indeed a
correct one. By this we mean that it is important to check whether the
optimal solution to this model is indeed an optimal path. We will see
that in some cases the optimal solution might not be a path or it
might be sub-optimal. These defects might however happen only when some
arc has negative cost, i.e., traversing an arc produces a gain,
instead of a cost. This might seem curious in general, but there are
many situations in which this is normal. Just as an example, there are
cases in which instead of minimizing costs, we would like to find a
path over which some kind of *utility* is maximized. Maximizing a
positive utility is equivalent to minimize its opposite, which is thus
a negative cost. 

A :index:`path` in a directed graph is a finite sequence

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   v_1,
   (v_1,v_2), v_2, (v_2,v_3), v_3,\ldots, v_k
   \end{align*}
   
such that

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   v_h & \in V & \forall\, h=1,k \\
   (v_h, v_{h+1}) & \in E & \forall\, h = 1, k-1
   \end{align*}

This sequence is composed
of nodes and arcs; when the graph has no parallel arcs (arcs with the
same end points), it
can be represented more simply and without ambiguity as a finite sequence of nodes :math:`v_1,
v_2, \ldots, v_k` where it is understood that :math:`(v_h,v_{h+1}) \in E`,
that is, every pair of consecutive nodes in the path is an arc in the
graph. 

Assume that the linear optimization model has an optimal solution.
The model is a special case of the
minimum cost flow and thus, being the right hand side of the model
integer, it is immediate to deduce that all basic solutions and, in
particular, an optimal one, will be integer. However it is not
granted that an optimal solution,  when it exists, is :math:`binary`.
This fact is not a problem in itself, as a flow larger than one might
represent a flow passing more than once trough an arc. However this is
the sign of possible difficulties, as we are going to show now.

Consider the following graph, where the label on each arc represents
the cost:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (A) at (2,0) {$A$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (5,0) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (7,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (3.5,-2) {$C$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   s/A/1,A/B/1,B/t/1,B/C/1,C/A/1
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

  
Here a :index:`directed cycle` exists in the graph: by this we mean a
directed path with the same start and end node. In this case, the node
sequence :math:`A,B,C,A` corresponds to a directed cycle. Although it is
evident that the minimum cost path in the graph is  :math:`s,A,B,t`, with
total cost 3, sub-optimal paths exist, like, e.g.,
:math:`s,A,B,C,A,B,t`. The flow along this path will be non binary: one unit
on :math:`(s,A),(B,C), (C,A), (B,t)`, but two units along :math:`(A,B)`,
corresponding to two passages along this arc. It is easy to imagine
how, going through the cycle more than once, other non binary feasible
solutions might be found. Of course, in this case, it will be costly
to traverse the cycle, so an optimal solution will be
:index:`acyclic`, i.e., it will not contain any cycle with positive flow. 

Assume now that the cost associated to arc :math:`(B,C)` is
:math:`-2`;


.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (A) at (2,0) {$A$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (5,0) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (7,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (3.5,-2) {$C$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   s/A/1,A/B/1,B/t/1,B/C/-2,C/A/1
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Now the situation is different because, thanks to this
negative cost, the overall cost of the cycle :math:`A,B,C,A` is null. Thus
it is possible to assign flow to this cycle, at no additional cost. As a
consequence, there exist optimal solutions which include a cycle and,
thus, have non binary flows. The cyclic solution :math:`s,A,B,C,A,B,t` has
the same cost as the optimal one and, thus, is optimal. It can be
proven, however, that in this problem feasible solutions which contain
cycles are not basic solutions: linear independence of the columns
associated to arcs with positive flow correspond to the absence of
cycles. Here with the term cycle we consider generic ones, i.e., even not
directed ones or, in other words, closed paths which, after possibly a
few changes in the direction of some arcs, turn into a directed
cycle.
Thus, even if an
optimal cyclic solution might exist, the fundamental theorem of linear
optimization grants that at least an 
optimal acyclic solution  exists too. And most of the commonly used linear
optimization algorithms will return such an optimal
basic solution.

However, going further with the example, assume now that the cost of
arc :math:`(B,C)`  is, say, :math:`-3`: now, going through the cycle :math:`A,B,C,A`
will "cost" :math:`-1`. In other words, the cycle gives us a positive
gain. It is now evident that it is worth going through the cycle. If
we traverse the cycle 1, 2, 3 times, the gain will be 1, 2, 3,...
From  this, it immediately follows that the minimum cost path problem
in this case becomes unsolvable or, more precisely, *unbounded*. Even in
this case, the linear optimization formulation given before is correct
and trying to solve that model in this case will correctly detect the
unboundedness of the problem. Difficulties however arise in a slightly
different situation. Consider the following example:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (A) at (2,0) {$A$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (4,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (2,-2) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (1,-4) {$C$};
   \node[vertex] (D) at (3,-4) {$D$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   s/A/1,A/t/1,B/A/1,C/D/-1,D/B/-1,B/C/-1
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Here there is a unique, thus optimal, path :math:`s,A,t` whose cost is 2.
However, the linear optimization model turns out to be unbounded,
as it is possible to assign any positive value to the arcs composing
cycle BCDB, without violating any constraint. Thus the linear
optimization model does not correctly represent the minimum cost path
problem in this case, as a consequence of a negative cost cycle in the
graph. We might think that bounding the flow over each arc to 1 might
solve the problem, but this is false. Indeed, assigning a finite upper
bound  to each arc will make the problem bounded. However, in this
case, the optimal solution would assign unit flow to :math:`(s,A), (A,t)`
but also to :math:`(B,C), (C,D), (D,B)`, thus returning an incorrect
solution with an incorrect total cost. In this case the solution,
although incorrect, contains the minimum cost path. Unfortunately, again,
this is not the case, in general. Consider the following example:   

.. tikz::
  
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (4,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (2,0) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (1,-2) {$C$};
   \node[vertex] (D) at (3,-2) {$D$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   s/B/1,B/t/1,D/C/-2,B/D/-1,C/B/-2,D/t/1
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Bounding the flow on each arc to 1 unit as a maximum, any linear
optimization software would return the following optimal solution, consisting of
one unit of flow on each arc, except arc  :math:`(D,t)`, with total cost
:math:`-3` (the flow is reported in red below each arc):

.. tikz::
  
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (4,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (2,0) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (1,-2) {$C$};
   \node[vertex] (D) at (3,-2) {$D$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\flow in {
   s/B/1/1,B/t/1/1,D/C/-2/1,B/D/-1/1,C/B/-2/1,D/t/1/0
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}}
   node[below,sloped,red]{\tiny{\flow}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

However, the minimum cost path is  :math:`s,B,D,t`,(cost: 1) which is not
contained in the linear optimization solution:

.. tikz::
  
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (t) at (4,0) {$t$};
   \node[vertex] (B) at (2,0) {$B$};
   \node[vertex] (C) at (1,-2) {$C$};
   \node[vertex] (D) at (3,-2) {$D$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\flow in {
   s/B/1/1,B/t/1/0,D/C/-2/0,B/D/-1/1,C/B/-2/0,D/t/1/1
   }
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}}
   node[below,sloped,red]{\tiny{\flow}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Concluding this section, it can be observed that problems arise when a
negative cost cycle is included in the graph. In these cases the 
linear model might not be correct and special care has to be taken in order to
avoid solution which include cycles. This can be done, as it will be
seen in chapter :ref:`Sequencing problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem`.
But the inclusion of constraints to avoid cycles will come at a huge
computational cost. It can be proven that, while the minimum cost path
is "easy", in the sense that it admits a solution time which grows
at most polynomially with the size of the problem, when negative
cycles are present the complexity becomes much higher and no
polynomial time algorithm is known, nor it is likely to be found in
the future.

It is also important to recall, however, that in the vast majority of
practical cases the linear model will be a correct representation of
the problem. Two wide classes of cases in which the model is granted
to be correct
are:

* graphs with non negative arc costs
* acyclic graphs, even with negative cost arcs

In the two cases above it is evident that no negative cost cycle can
exist. It is not difficult to prove that in these cases the linear
model will be a correct one for the minimum cost
path problem.

Going back to the application of this model, let us consider the
following application. 

:application: :index:`Minimum resistance path in an electrical network`

Consider the following minimum cost path problem:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y in
   {-/0/4,A/2/4,B/4/4,C/6/4,D/2/2,E/4/2,F/0/0,G/2/0,+/4/0}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {$\nod$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   -/A/100,-/F/250,A/B/250,A/D/100,A/F/300,B/C/120,B/D/250,
   B/E/100,C/E/250,D/E/230,D/F/200,E/F/150,E/G/50,E/+/110,
   F/G/300,G/+/90
   }
   \draw[arc,-] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

This graph is undirected, but we can consider it as a directed graph
in which each edge corresponds to two arcs, in opposite directions,
each with the same cost as displayed. Assume we wish to find the
minimum cost path from node :math:`-`  to node :math:`+`. This network might be an
electrical one and we are interested in finding the minimum total resistance
path in the network, assuming the labels of each edge are the
resistances associated to each connection.

Solving this problem either with a specialized shortest path algorithm
or with a generic linear optimization tool, we obtain the optimal
solution as :math:`-,F,E,+` with total cost 510.

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y in
   {-/0/4,A/2/4,B/4/4,C/6/4,D/2/2,E/4/2,F/0/0,G/2/0,+/4/0}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {$\nod$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\flow in {
   -/A/100/ ,-/F/250/1,A/B/250/ ,A/D/100/ ,A/F/300/ ,B/C/120/
   ,B/D/250/ ,
   B/E/100/ ,C/E/250/ ,D/E/230/ ,D/F/200/ ,E/F/150/1,E/G/50/ ,E/+/110/
   1,
   F/G/300/ ,G/+/90/ }
   \draw[arc,-] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} node[below,sloped,red]{\tiny{\flow}} (\fin);
   \foreach \ini/\fin in {-/F,F/E,E/+}
   \draw[arc,red] (\ini) -- (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dual of the minimum cost path model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we analyze the *dual* of the linear model for the
minimum cost path problem (assuming it correctly represents the
minimum cost path problem).
Consider the matrix representation of the minimum cost path problem:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min_{\var{f}} \param{c}^T \var{f} & \\
   \param{A} \var{f} & = \mathbf{e}_s-\mathbf{e}_t \\
   \var{f} & \geq 0
   \end{align*}

where :math:`\param{A} \in \{-1, 0, +1\}^{|V| \times |E|}` is the :index:`incidence
matrix` of the graph and :math:`\mathbf{e}_v \in \R^{|V|}` is a binary vector
whose components are all zero except the one associated to node
:math:`v`. Thus the right hand side is +1 in the equation of the
origin node, -1 in that of the destination and zero otherwise. 

This is a standard linear optimization model whose dual is immediately
found to be

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max_{\mathvar{\lambda}} \mathvar{\lambda}^T (\mathbf{e}_s-\mathbf{e}_t) & \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}^T \param{A} & \leq \param{c}
   \end{align*}

where :math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_i` denotes the vector of
dual variable associated to the nodes of the
graph. The dual problem, in explicit form, turns out to be

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{t} & \label{eq: sp-dual-espl} \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} & \leq
   \param{c}_{ij} & \forall \, (i, j) \in E
   \end{align*}
 
Consider the previous example of an electrical network. Dual variables
can be thought of as node :index:`potentials`. If a voltage is applied
between the two special  nodes :math:`+,-`, the objective function of the
dual corresponds to the maximization of the :index:`difference of potential`,
or :index:`tension`,
between the source and the terminal
nodes (negative and positive nodes). Constraints can be interpreted as
limits on the maximum allowable tension :math:`\param{c}_{ij}` at the extremes of each
arc :math:`(i,j)`.
Thus the dual of the shortest path problem is a problem of maximum
tension with bounds on the tension at each arc. It can be seen that
node potentials never appear isolated in the constraints or the
objective; in each expression, the difference between two potentials
always appear. Thus each feasible solution, and in particular, an
optimal one, can always be modified by adding a constant to each
potential (dual variable). Seen in a different way, the dual problem has a "free"
variable, which can be set to an arbitrary value. As an example, we
might chose any node and fix its potential to zero (or *ground*).
This redundancy in the dual variables is connected with a "primal"
redundancy: a balance constraint can be arbitrarily chosen and deleted
from the model, without changing the set of feasible solutions. It is
not difficult to show that, if, in the primal, the balance constraint   
associated to node :math:`i` is canceled then in the dual the optimal
solution will correspond to one in which :math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_i = 0`.
 
In the example above, an optimal solution to the dual problem is
reported in the following figure:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}]
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y/\nam in
   {-/0/4/0,A/2/4/-100,B/4/4/-300,C/6/4/-420,D/2/2/-200,E/4/2/-400,F/0/0/-250,G/2/0/-450,+/4/0/-510}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {\tiny{\nam}};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in {
   -/A/100,-/F/250,A/B/250,A/D/100,A/F/300,B/C/120,B/D/250,
   B/E/100,C/E/250,D/E/230,D/F/200,E/F/150,E/G/50,E/+/110,
   F/G/300,G/+/90
   }
   \draw[arc,dotted,-] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \foreach \ini/\fin in {
   -/F,F/E,E/+}
   \draw[arc,=>,very thick] (\ini) -- (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

   
From this solution it is also possible to notice that, as a
consequence of complementarity, on all arcs on which a positive
(primal) flow is assigned, there cannot be any slack in the dual
constraint. In particular we can observe that

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \mathvar{\lambda}_F - \mathvar{\lambda}_{-}  & = 250 \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_E - \mathvar{\lambda}_{F}  & = 150 \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{+} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{E}  & = 110 \\
   \end{align*}

An alternative interpretation of the dual of the minimum cost path
problem is a mechanical one.
Consider  a  physical model of a graph, made of strings,
in which  nodes are knots and arc lengths are proportional to arc costs.
Considering the dual, as a maximum tension problem, it is possible to
think to an analogical solution procedure, in which nodes :math:`s` and :math:`t`
are pulled in opposite directions as much as possible, without exceeding
the length of each arc.  
When a maximum tension is reached, an optimal, minimum length path,
will be in tension. Consider the following example:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y in {s/-2/0,A/0/1,B/0/-1,t/2/0}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {$\nod$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\where in
   {s/A/10/above,s/B/15/below,A/B/5/above,A/t/15/above,B/t/20/below}
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[\where,sloped]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

It is easy to see that the minimum cost path is :math:`sAt` and that
assigning potential 25 to the node :math:`s`, 15 to :math:`A`,
20 to :math:`B`  and 0 to
:math:`t`,  an optimal dual solution is obtained. This solution can
be represented with the string model as in the next graph (please
notice that in this picture arc lengths are not correctly scaled):

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8,in = -45, out = -135]
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y in {s/3/0,A/-1/0,B/1/0,t/-6/0}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {$\nod$};
   \path[draw,very thick,->] (s) -- node [above right=0mm and 1em] {10} (A);
   \path[draw,->,in=-90,out=-90] (s) edge node [below] {15} (B);
   \path[draw,->] (B) edge node [above] {5} (A);
   \path[draw,very thick,->] (A) -- node [above] {15} (t);
   \path[draw,->] (B) edge node [below] {20} (t);
   \end{tikzpicture}
 
It is seen that, as prescribed by complementarity, the optimal path is
"in tension" and no slack exists between adjacent nodes along the
optimal path: their potential difference, which, in this case, is
simply their distance, is equal to the right hand side (the cost). On
the other end, nodes not on the optimal path (node :math:`B` in the example)
have incident arcs whose length can be, and in the example are,
strictly greater than their cost (length).  

It might seem that this physical model is slightly unrealistic, being
the arcs in the graph oriented. On the contrary we may assume that the
graph is not directed and arc costs represent arc lengths. In this
case we might build an equivalent network in which every undirected arc
is transformed into two arcs with the same cost and opposite
orientation. In this case to each arc in the graph two inequalities
are found in the dual formulation:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{t}  \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} & \leq
   \param{c}_{ij} & \forall \, (i, j) \in E \\
      \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} & \leq
   \param{c}_{ij} & \forall \, (i, j) \in E
   \end{align*}

and it is immediately seen that this is equivalent to

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{t}  \\
   | \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} | & \leq
   \param{c}_{ij} & \forall \, (i, j) \in E
   \end{align*}

and the main constraints represent distance upper bounds for each
pair of nodes connected by an arc.
 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Applications of the minimum cost path model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many problems, sometimes apparently unrelated to minimum cost paths,
can be traced back to this scheme. In this paragraph
we will analyze a few of them.
 
:application: :index:`Maximum reliability path`
	      
Consider a graph representing, as an example, a road network.
Assume that a statistics on the :math:`reliability` of each arc is
available. The term "reliability" might have different definitions
in various contexts. Here we assume that the reliability of an arc is
an estimate of the probability that the arc can be "safely"
traversed. In a road arc, it can be linked to incidentality and
defined as one minus the incident rate of the road. In a
telecommunication network it might be the probability of the
connection being available.
Let :math:`\param{p}_{ij}` be the probability that an arc
:math:`(i, j)` can be traversed without accidents (or that it is
available for message passing in telecommunication networks). We
assume that accidents in different roads are not correlated,
and, in particular, that there is stochastic independence between
events in different arcs of the graph. This assumption, in road
traffic, might be reasonable in situations of light traffic, or in
extra-urban or secondary roads, when
accidents are mostly due to road conditions and not to congestion.

As a consequence of the assumption of stochastic independence, given a
set of arcs :math:`I \subseteq E`, their joint reliability, i.e., the
probability that no accident will occur in any of the arcs is given by

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \prod_{(i, j) \in I} \param{p}_{ij}.
   \end{align*}

The problem of finding a :index:`Maximum reliability path` in a graph
can be formulated as  follows, where the constraints force basic
feasible solutions to be paths:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \prod_{(i, j) \in E: \var{f}_{ij} = 1} \param{p}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{j: (v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{i: (i, v) \in E} \var{f}_{iv}
   & = \left \{
   \begin{array} {rl}
   1 & \textrm{if } v = s \\
   -1 & \textrm{if } v = t \\
   0 & \textrm{otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right. & \forall \, v & \in V \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \in \{0,1 \} & (i, j) & \in E
   \end{align*}

This, as an optimization problem, is apparently very complex: a
product of terms appears in the objective and
variables are in the index of the product operator. Moreover,
although it is true that the constraints associate basic feasible
solutions to paths (provided the 
assumptions connected with the absence of negative cost cycles hold),
given the form of the  objective it is not granted, a priori, that optimal solutions will
be basic ones. Notice also that binary constraints are imposed on all
variables, as the integrality property cannot be assumed to hold for general
problems different from linear network flow ones.

However a simplification of this formulation is indeed possible, and
will lead to a network flow problem.
Recall that in any optimization problem, applying a
monotonically increasing function to the objective does not change the
location of optima. That is, given a problem

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min_{x \in S} f (x)
   \end{align*}
   
if  :math:`x^\star` is an optimal solution and :math:`\phi(\cdot) : \R
\rightarrow \R` is increasing, then :math:`x^\star`  will be an optimal solution of the
problem

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \min_{x \in S} \phi (f (x))
   \end{align*}

and vice-versa.

The same applies to maximization problems too.
Thus, assuming without loss of generality that no arc exists with zero
reliability, a logarithmic transformation of the objective function
can be safely applied. Thus the maximum reliability  problem can be
equivalently represented as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_{(i, j) \in E: \var{f}_{ij} = 1} \log (\param{p}_{ij}) & \\
   \sum_{j: (v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{i: (i, v) \in E} \var{f}_{iv}
   & = \left \{
   \begin{array} {rl}
   1 & \textrm{if } v = s \\
   -1 & \textrm{if } v = t \\
   0 & \textrm{otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right. & \forall \, v & \in V \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \in \{0,1 \} & (i, j) & \in E
   \end{align*}
 
But now we can observe that binary variables can be used to include or
exclude specific terms in a summation and we can transform the problem
as follows:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \log (\param{p}_{ij}) \var{f}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{j: (v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{i: (i, v) \in E} \var{f}_{iv}
   & = \left \{
   \begin{array} {rl}
   1 & \textrm{if } v = s \\
   -1 & \textrm{if } v = t \\
   0 & \textrm{otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right. & \forall \, v & \in V \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \geq 0 & (i, j) & \in E.
   \end{align*}
 
Observe that binary constraints on the variables have been removed,
as this  is a pure  linear flow model and the integrality  of the
optimal solution is
guaranteed. We can also observe that this problem, when transformed
into a minimization one, has non negative costs on each arc, so the
optimal solution will be a path:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   - \min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} (- \log (\param{p}_{ij})) \var{f}_{ij}.
   \end{align*}

As an example, consider the following reliability network:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \nod/\x/\y in {s/0/4,a/2/4,d/4/4,c/0/2,b/2/2,t/4/0,e/2/0}
   \node[vertex] (\nod) at (\x,\y) {$\nod$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost in
   {s/a/0.91,s/b/0.94,s/c/0.96,a/d/0.94,a/b/0.93,b/c/0.91,b/d/0.93,c/e/0.94,
   d/t/0.99,e/t/0.94}
   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[sloped,above]{\tiny{\cost}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Transforming the problem as explained and running a minimum cost path
solver, the optimal solution turns out to be :math:`s-b-d-t` with
overall reliability :math:`0.902286`.
This result has been obtained by running a linear optimization solver
on the following data:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/reliability.dat
   :caption: reliability.dat
   :language: ampl
 
Notice from one side that, through a transformation of the data, the
standard shortest path model was used. On the other hand, it is worth
recalling that this problem is so special that much more efficient
algorithms do exist to solve it to optimality, even for huge
dimensional problems. It is out of the scope of this volume to go into
these algorithmic details.

Going back to the example, a myopic strategy 
which starts by choosing the  most reliable outgoing arc, in this
case, would produce the path :math:`s-c-e-t` whose reliability is only
:math:`0.848256`; by the way, such a strategy is not even granted to find a
feasible path.
 
This model finds applications in the field of
dangerous  or highly polluting goods transportation, where minimizing
accident probability is a typical objective.
In this context, sometimes the objective to be minimized is the  expected
damage (e.g., the expected number of possibly affected people
or the expected monetary damage in case of an
accident).
This situation is easier to model, as, after having
associated an expected damage to each arc, the overall cost of a path
would be just the sum of the expected costs on the arcs of the path. Thus a
regular minimum cost path is generated.
Finally, it is appropriate to remember that  often in problems related to
environmental issues several  objectives coexist: frequently the
decision maker would like to obtain a path  with
minimal risk, high reliability, low cost, short distance, ...
In these cases a   *multi-objective* approach is required, a topic
which will be dealt with later on (see section
:ref:`Multiple Objectives`).

     
:application: :index:`Project planning`

When dealing with complex projects it is often
very difficult to estimate the total time needed to complete them.
However, there are a number of methodological tools and software that make 
the process of planning much easier.

The most common scheme 
corresponds to the situation in which  a complex project
can be subdivided into a number of "elementary" activities whose duration can be estimated
with sufficient accuracy.
Such activities are to be considered as elementary ones, in the sense
that they cannot be further split into sub--activities and, once
started, they are carried on until completion without interruptions.
Between some pairs of activities there might be a precedence relation.
The most common of these relationships is expressed as

*"activity* :math:`j` *cannot start until  activity* :math:`i`
*is completed"* (start / end relationship).

Denoting by :math:`t_{i}` 
the starting time of activity :math:`i` and with :math:`s`
and :math:`t` respectively the activities associated to the start
and to the end of the whole project
(these activities in some cases might be fictitious)
the problem of finding a  minimum duration plan  for the whole
project, taking into account precedence relationships,  can be
modeled as follows:

.. _cpm:

:model: Project planning

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{A}`: set of activities to be carried out
   * :math:`\set{P} \subseteq \set{A} \times \set{A}`: set of
     pairs of activities among which a start/end precedence needs to
     be imposed. The elements of each pair
     are called predecessor and successor

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|

   * :math:`s \in \set{A}`: project start activity; it can be
     fictitious, that is, it can be an activity of null duration whose only
     purpose is to set the start time/date of the whole project.
     This activity has no predecessors;
   * :math:`t \in
     \set{A}`: end of project; similarly to the previous one
     it is generally a fictitious one, with no successors.
   * :math:`\param{d}_i`: duration of  activity :math:`i \in \set{A}`;

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\var{t}_i`: start time of activity :math:`i \in \set{A}`

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * Precedence constraint between selected pairs activities:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
        \var{t}_{j} \geq \var{t}_{i} + \param{d}_{i} \quad \forall \, (i, j) \in \set{P}
	\end{align*}
	
    This constraint expresses the fact that if there is a precedence between
    activity :math:`i` and activity :math:`j`, then the start time of
    activity :math:`j` cannot be set before a  time period of length
    :math:`d_i` passed since the beginning of activity :math:`i`.

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   Minimization of the overall duration of the
   project, equal to  the difference between the
   project end and start times:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \min \var{t}_{t} - \var{t}_{s}
      \end{align*}

      
It is easy to see that
this problem is  a particular case of the dual of a minimum cost path
problem (in this case, indeed,  of *maximum* cost path) expressed in
the following form

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_{i} \param{d}_{i} \sum_{j} \var{f}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{j: (v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{i: (i, v) \in E} \var{f}_{iv}
   & = \left \{
   \begin{array} {rl}
   1 & \textrm{if } v = s \\
   -1 & \textrm{if } v = t \\
   0 & \textrm{otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right. & \forall \, v \in V
   \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \geq 0 & \forall \, (i, j) \in E
   \end{align*}
   
where the nodes of the graph are associated to the  activities and the arcs correspond to
precedence relationships between two consecutive activities.

Indeed, the dual of a *maximum* cost path problem 

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \max_{\var{f}} \param{c}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{j} \var{f}_{vj} -     \sum_{i} \var{f}_{iv} & = \mathbf{e}_s - \mathbf{e}_t & \forall\, v \in
   \set{V} \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \geq 0 & \forall\,(i,j) \in \set{E}
   \end{align*}

can be found by first transforming the above problem into an
equivalent minimization one:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   -\min_{\var{f}} -\param{c}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{j} \var{f}_{vj} -     \sum_{i} \var{f}_{iv} & = \mathbf{e}_{s} -
   \mathbf{e}_{t} &\forall\, v \in
   \set{V} \\
   \var{f}_{ij} & \geq 0 & \forall\,(i,j) \in \set{E}
   \end{align*}

and then going to the dual:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   -\max \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{t} &\\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} & \leq
   -\param{c}_{ij} & \forall \, (i, j) \in E 
   \end{align*}

or
 
.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \min \mathvar{\lambda}_{t} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} &  \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} & \geq  \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} + \param{c}_{ij} &
   \forall \, (i, j) \in E  
   \end{align*}

The optimal solution to this problem is a 
*maximum cost path* which, in this context, is called
:index:`critical path`. It is important to observe that this problem
can always be solved by the above linear optimization models (although
there exist enormously more efficient algorithms), since the graph of 
precedence relationships needs to be acyclic: this derives
from the observation that, if a cycle 
:math:`v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k = v_1` existed in the graph,
this would mean that  activity
:math:`v_1` should precede activity :math:`v_2`, which
precedes activity :math:`v_3` and so on until the last
:math:`v_1`. If this  was the case, :math:`v_1` would precede
itself, which is obviously absurd.
 
Given the well known relationship between a linear optimization
problem and its  dual, the cost
of the critical path is equal to the minimum duration of the project;
moreover the
activities associated with  nodes  on the critical path
are responsible for the total duration of the project.  This fact can be deduced
as a consequence of the  complementary slackness property: along
the arcs on  which the flow associated  to the optimal
(or critical) path is non zero (equal to one),
in the corresponding dual the slack must be  zero;
in other words, the start time of the next activity must be
exactly equal to the start time of the previous one plus its
duration. This means that between the end
of the preceding activity and the beginning of the next one, along the
critical path, there can be no delay.
If even a single activity belonging to the critical path is
delayed, the whole project would be delayed (from
which the adjective "critical").

In the following we present a model for project planning, derived with
tiny variations from the generic shortest path model, and a tiny
example, inspired by planning a simple cooking recipe:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/cpm.mod
   :caption: cpm.mod
   :language: ampl

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/cpm.dat
   :caption: cpm.dat
   :language: ampl

The only changes with respect to the basic shortest path model
are simply the redefinition of the objective function (which
now is a maximization) and the definition of the cost associated 
to each arc, based on the duration of the activities. The model
presented above can be easily generalized allowing that the cost on
each arc is any positive number, removing in this way the requirement
that every arc out from an activity has the same cost, equal to the
duration of that activity. There might in fact be situation in which
different activities with a common predecessor require a different
amount of time before being allowed to start.

A graphical representation of the project network implemented in the
above data file is the following:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=0.7]
   \node[whitevertex] (s) at (-2,5) {S};
   \node[whitevertex] (BW) at (0,10) {BW};
   \node[whitevertex] (CO) at (0,8) {CO};
   \node[whitevertex] (CG) at (0,6) {CG};

   \node[whitevertex] (CS) at (4,10) {CS};
   \node[whitevertex] (FO) at (4,7) {FO};
   \node[whitevertex] (CT) at (5,5) {CT};
   \node[whitevertex] (PS) at (7,5) {PS};
   \node[whitevertex] (SS) at (9,5) {SS};
   \node[whitevertex] (t) at (11,5) {End};
   \path[draw,->] (s) -- (CO);
   \path[draw, ->, thick, color = red] (s) -- (BW);
   \path[draw, ->] (s) -- (CG);
   \path[draw, ->] (s) -- (PT);
   \path[draw, ->] (s) -- (SG);
   \path[draw, ->] (CO) -- node[above] {2} (FO);
   \path[draw, ->] (PT) -- node[above] {3} (CT);
   \path[draw, ->] (CG) -- node[above] {2} (CT);
   \path[draw, ->] (FO) -- node[above] {2} (CT);
   \path[draw, ->] (CT) -- node[above] {10} (PS);
   \path[draw, ->, thick, color = red] (BW) -- node[above left] {10} (CS);
   \path[draw, ->] (PS) -- node[above] {3} (SS);
   \path[draw, ->, thick, color = red] (CS) -- node[above] {8} (SS);
   \path[draw, ->, thick, color = red] (SS) -- node[above] {1} (t);
   \path[draw, ->] (SG) -- node[above] {1} (t);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Running a general purpose linear optimization solver on this example,
a solution of cost 19 is obtained, associated with the critical path
emphasized in red in the graph above. 
It is important to recall that
problems of this kind can be solved by means of
extremely efficient  algorithms consisting in a suitable "visit"
of the graph and  based on simple
sorting algorithms. By running an optimization algorithm, non zero
flow variables
represent critical paths, while values associated with the dual variables
represent possible 
start times of each activity. Alternative optimal schedules can be obtained by
summing a constant to all of these dual variables.
 
Frequently in project planning a  graphical representation is used
which goes under the name of  :index:`Gantt chart`. In this
diagram to  each activity a bar is associated whose
length is proportional to its duration  and whose position, along a
time axis, depends on  the start and end time obtained after finding
an optimal plan. The next figure reports a Gantt chart for the
example above:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=1.5,xscale=0.4]
   \foreach \lab/\start/\from/\to/\col in
   {BW/4.5/0/10/red,
   CO/4/0/2/yellow,
   CG/3.5/0/2/yellow,
   SG/3/0/1/yellow,
   PT/2.5/0/3/yellow,
   FO/2/2/4/yellow,
   CT/1.5/4/14/yellow,
   PS/1/14/17/yellow,
   CS/.5/10/18/red,
   SS/0/18/19/red}{
   \filldraw[fill=\col, line width=1pt] (\from,\start) rectangle (\to,\start+0.4);
   \node[above left] at (0,\start) {\lab};
   };
   \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid[xstep=1,ystep=100] (20,5);
   \end{tikzpicture}

From a standard Gantt chart it is possible to deduce
the detailed plan of activities, and, through the use of color,
it is possible to show the critical path. In classical Gantt charts,
however, it is usually not possible to see precedence relationships,
although this can be easily done adding some arcs over the
chart. Usually, for non critical activities, the "slack", can also be
represented, as shown in the following chart:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=1.5,xscale=0.4]
   \foreach \lab/\start/\from/\to/\col in
   {BW/4.5/0/10/red,
   CO/4/0/2/yellow,
   CG/3.5/0/2/yellow,
   SG/3/0/1/yellow,
   PT/2.5/0/3/yellow,
   FO/2/2/4/yellow,
   CT/1.5/4/14/yellow,
   PS/1/14/17/yellow,
   CS/.5/10/18/red,
   SS/0/18/19/red}{
   \filldraw[fill=\col, line width=1pt] (\from,\start) rectangle (\to,\start+0.4);
   \node[above left] at (0,\start) {\lab};
   };
   \foreach \start/\from/\to in
   {4/2/3/,
   3.5/2/5,
   3/1/19,
   2.5/3/5,
   2/4/5,
   1.5/14/15,
   1/17/18}{\filldraw[pattern color=green, pattern=north east lines,
   line width=1pt] (\from,\start) 
   rectangle (\to,\start+0.4);}; 
   \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid[xstep=1,ystep=100] (20,5);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Colored in green it is possible to see the so-called  "float", i.e.
the delay that a given activity might allow without causing
a delay to the whole project; this information can be inferred from the
constraint slack.

If the problem is solved by means of a linear optimization solver
(which is discouraged, as there exist much more efficient tools for
this basic scenario) it is worth observing that dual variables will
represent  just one out of the possibly infinite number of optimal
start times for the activities. There is in fact nothing in the
formulation which induces, as an example, all activities to start at
the earliest possible time (which is the one reported in the Gantt
charts).  
 
In real project planning 
situations, constraints often are more complex than
those seen before, based on  the start/end  precedence. It is  very easy
to modify the dual  model presented here in order to represent
constraints such as: "activity :math:`i` cannot start later than
:math:`\param{g}` days  from  the start of activity, :math:`j`", or
"activities :math:`h,k` must end simultaneously".  In formulae:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \mathvar{\lambda}_i & \leq \mathvar{\lambda}_j + \param{g} \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_h + \param{d}_h & = \mathvar{\lambda}_k + \param{d}_k
   \end{align*}
 
Although, as mentioned, the solution of a problem of
project planning is extremely simple from a 
computational point of view and does not require the use of tools
like the simplex method, it is anyway important
to present the formulation of the problem in terms of
a linear model since in practical
project planning, additional constraints frequently appear, which
cannot be dealt with unless specialized project planning algorithms
are available.
 
A frequently required constraint which makes the problem significantly
more complex is  related to 
implicit precedences, caused by  the limited availability of some
resources.
In the example above, assume that a single fire is
available, so that, e.g.,  it is not possible to simultaneously boil
the water and fry the onions.
It is thus necessary to include a  constraint to  force these two
activities, which require the same resource, not to
overlap.
In this case  a
"disjunctive" constraint needs to be imposed: either  activity BW
follows FO or, in
alternative, activity FO should follow BW:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \textbf{Either } \, \mathvar{\lambda}_{BW} & \geq \mathvar{\lambda}_{FO} + 2 
    \\
   \textbf{Or}\, \mathvar{\lambda}_{FO} & \geq \mathvar{\lambda}_{BW} + 10 
   \end{align*}
   
This type of "OR" constraint cannot be
formulated through  linear equalities or inequalities and makes the problem
extremely more complex. We will see how to formulate this and other
kinds of logical constraints in  chapter
:ref:`Using binary variables to impose constraints`. The example above is clearly only
partial - if the conflict for the use of resources were limited to
two activities only, a quick-and-dirty solution could simply be that of
solving two optimal project planning problems, using one of the two
possible precedence relationships in the model and choosing the one
which produces the shortest total duration. However when, as
already in this tiny example, the conflicts for one or more scarce
resources causes more than just two activities to be incompatible, an
explicit enumeration of all possible combination would immediately
lead to an exponential number of instances to be solved.

It can be shown that planning when resources are so scarce as to cause
the decision maker to impose a sequence on pairs of  activities  which
otherwise might be planned in parallel is an hard combinatorial
optimization problem, for which no efficient algorithm is known.
Commercial software tools are usually based on heuristic procedures
which might produce plans which are quite far from being
optimal. Thanks to the model described above, as we will see in later
chapters, the problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear
optimization problem which, although very complex in theory, might
nonetheless be solved to optimality thanks to the advances of recent
optimization software, at least for moderately sized project planning instances.

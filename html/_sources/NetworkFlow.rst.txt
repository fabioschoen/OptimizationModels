Network flow models
*******************
 
In this chapter a class of very important models will be introduced,
all belonging to the class of network flow models. They can be thought
of as representing the flow of some material (e.g., a liquid or a gas,
but also vehicles or bits) along a (physical) network. These models lend
themselves to theoretical analysis, to the development of specialized
solution methods and to modeling much diverse situations, some of
which apparently far from the concept of flows. The models we will
introduce are, with few exceptions,
linear optimization ones, and, thus, they inherit both the theory and the
algorithms known for generic linear optimization. However their structure
make them well suited for extremely efficient, specialized algorithms, capable of
solving problems of huge size. The literature on network flow models
and methods is very large; here we just mention :cite:`Ahuja93`, an
excellent classic on this subject - although significant improvements have
been observed in recent years and some of the proposed methods are
nowadays slightly outdated, the book is an excellent reading for its
clearness, depth and coverage.

=================
Minimum cost flow
=================

Assume a :index:`graph` :math:`G` is given.  
Definitions related to the elements of graph theory are briefly
summarized in the Appendix: :ref:`Graphs: basic definitions`. 
The generic :index:`minimum cost flow` model can be defined as
follows:

     
.. role:: model
   :class: smallcaps
	   
:model: Minimum cost flow

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{V}`: set of vertices or nodes of the graph
   * :math:`\set{E} \subseteq V \times V`: set of arcs; unless
     stated otherwise, arcs are  directed, i.e. :math:`(i,j)  \ne (j,i)`;

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|

   * :math:`\param{b}_i` (balance): net output / input balance for
     node :math:`i \in V`.
     This quantity represents
     the  difference between the total outflow from node :math:`i` and the total inflow
     for the same node. A positive balance is associated to nodes which
     generate  flow, a negative one with consumer nodes, while
     zero balance corresponds to transit nodes;
     
  * :math:`\param{L}_{ij}, \param{U}_{ij}` (lower and upper bounds
    on arc flows): on each arc :math:`(i, j) \in E`
    a minimum flow can be imposed
    (frequently equal to 0) as well as a maximum one (sometimes
    absent, or equal to :math:`+ \infty`) 

  * :math:`\param{c}_{ij}`: cost associated with one unit of flow
    passing through  arc :math:`(i, j) \in E`;

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\var{f}_{ij}`: the amount of flow through arc :math:`(i, j)`

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * :index:`Flow conservation` or balance equations:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\[
	\sum_{k: (i, k) \in E} \var{f}_{ik} - \sum_{h: (h, i) \in E}
        \var{f}_{hi} = \param{b}_i \qquad \forall \, i \in V
	\]
	
     This constraint  forces the difference between flow out from
     node  :math:`i`  and the  entering flow to be
     equal to  :math:`\param{b}_i`.

   * Bounds:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\[
	\param{L}_{ij} \leq \var{f}_{ij} \leq \param{U}_{ij} \qquad \forall \, (i, j) \in E
	\]

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   * Objective:  total cost minimization:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\[
	\min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{c}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij}
	\]


In matrix form the problem might be represented as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min_\var{f} c^T \var{f} & \\
   \param{A} \var{f} & = \param{b} \\
   \param{L} \leq \var{f} & \leq \param{U}
   \end{align*}

where :math:`\param{A} \in \{-1, 0, +1\}^{|V| \times |E|}` is the :index:`incidence
matrix` of the graph (see the Appendix :ref:`Graphs: basic definitions`).
While for modeling purposes this representation is less useful than
the explicit one, it becomes interesting for theoretical
analysis. In particular it might be proven that the incidence matrix
enjoys the :index:`total unimodularity` property. This means that
every square sub-matrix of :math:`\param{A}` has either 0 or 1 or -1 determinant. A
fundamental consequence of this is the fact that, as the inverse of an
integer matrix with determinant :math:`\pm 1` is still integer, all basic
solution of the above linear optimization model are granted to be
integer, provided that :math:`\param{b}, \param{L}, \param{U}` are
integer. Thus, in this case, from the fundamental theorem of linear
optimization, if the problem admits an optimal solution, then it will
admit an optimal *basic* solution whose components are all integer. In
this case, thus, there is no need to look for specialized, and
significantly more complex, algorithms if an integer solution is
required. Integrality comes for free in network flow models, under the
assumption of integrality of the above terms. It is worth reminding
that this fundamental property is usually lost as soon as even a
single constraint which cannot be considered as a balance equation or
as a bound on the flow on a single arc is added to the model.    

In the definition of the  minimum cost flow model some assumptions are
made, some of which can be relaxed, although with some disadvantages:
usually, extending the model will compromise the integrality
property of optimal basic solutions:

1. It is required that

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{i \in \set{V}} \param{b}_{i} & = 0
      \end{align*}
      
   This assumption cannot be relaxed:  if it is not satisfied, then no feasible
   flow can be found in the network. In fact,  summing all balance
   equations, it can be seen that the variable associated to any
   arc :math:`(i,j)` appears in exactly two flow balance equations: the flow
   balance of node :math:`i`, where it appears with coefficient +1,
   and the flow balance of 
   node :math:`j`, with coefficient   -1. Therefore, summing all balance
   equation, a null left hand side is obtained. Thus, in order for the
   system of equations to admit solutions, it is necessary (although
   not sufficient) that the sum
   of the right hand sides is zero too.

2. The network is oriented;
   if this were not the case, frequently it is possible to associate to each
   undirected arc (an :index:`edge`) a pair of directed arcs.
   This modeling solution is feasible, provided that a capacity can be assigned
   to each of the two directions; this is  the case when a two-way road
   can be seen as two one-way roads, each of which with its own capacity.
   A different situation occurs when
   the two directions share the same capacity and thus, if a large
   amount of flow is present on one direction, the other one will have
   a more limited capacity. In this case, if the undirected edge is
   :math:`(i, j)` and the maximum (shared) capacity is :math:`\param{U}`, after
   the substitution of the edge with two directed arcs :math:`(i,j)` and :math:`(j,i)`,
   the following constraint needs to be added

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \var{f}_{ij} + \var{f}_{ji} & \leq \param{U}
      \end{align*}

   This constraint is a linear inequality, so the overall problem is
   again a linear optimization one, although no more a minimum cost
   network flow problem. In fact this constraint cannot be seen as a
   flow balance constraint or a simple bound on flow variables. The
   main negative consequence of this, besides not being able to
   exploit the specialized algorithms for network flow problems, is
   that the inclusion of even a single constraint of this kind usually
   destroys the integrality property of the problem. Thus, if an
   integer flow is looked for, this will not be granted by simply
   solving the linear optimization problem.
   
3. The flow is  "single commodity".  Thus the demand of nodes
   with negative balance can be satisfied by the production of any
   node whose balance is positive. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to deal
   with separate  flows; as an example, consider a transportation
   network in which some origin nodes produce vehicles and some
   destination nodes ask for  produced vehicles: if products differ in
   color, size, brand, it will be necessary to keep all of the  flows of each
   product type well separated from each other, so that each customer will receive the
   correct quantity of the required products. This situation originates
   so--called :index:`multi-commodity flow` models. It is easy
   to take into account different flow types by adding a
   further index to each flow variable, like, e.g., :math:`\var{f}_{ij}^k` meant
   to model the flow on arc :math:`(i,j)` of products  of type :math:`k`. In some
   cases these multiple flows give simply rise to several, distinct
   and independent, network flow models, one for each flow
   type. Sometimes, however, there will be "linking" constraints
   which create a dependency between flows of different
   commodities. An elementary example is, again that of shared arc
   capacity. If the maximum amount of flow along arc :math:`(i,j)` is
   :math:`\param{U}`, this limit must not be exceeded, whichever the commodity
   associated to that arc.
   As an example, referring again to the vehicle production example,
   transportation on each arc might be done with a single truck with a
   finite capacity  of :math:`\param{U}` vehicles.
   To model this situation we might simply add constraints like:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{k \in \set{ProductTypes}} \var{f}_{ij}^k & \leq U_{ij}
      \end{align*}
      
   Again, this linear constraint usually destroys the integrality
   property enjoyed by pure network flow problems.
   
4. No flow losses or gains are possible long an arc. It is thus assumed that the
   amount of flow entering an arc is kept unchanged until the end of the
   arc. Sometimes, however, we might wish to model arc losses or
   gains. As an example, in an hydraulic network, there might be flow
   losses along pipes, proportional to the amount of flow. 
   In modeling financial flows it might happen that the flow leaving a
   node represents an amount of money, e.g., in €, while at the end
   of the arc we would like to have that amount in US$, through a
   multiplication by the current exchange rate. So, as an example, if
   100€  start from arc :math:`(i,j)`, they will be transformed into,
   say, 120 US$ at the end of the arc:

   .. tikz::

      \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[vertex] at (0,0) (1) {€};
      \node[vertex] at (4,0) (2) {\$};
      \draw[arc] (1) -- node[above right]{$\times 1.20$} (2);
      \end{tikzpicture}

   A model including this kind of behavior can be easily built
   starting from the generic one. In fact it is sufficient to include
   the multiplier on the arc in the corresponding balance equation. In
   particular, if flow along a specific arc :math:`(i,j)` gets multiplied by
   a factor :math:`\theta`, the balance equation associated to the destination
   node should become

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{k: (j, k) \in E} \var{f}_{jk} - \sum_{h: (h, j) \in
      E, h \ne i}
      \var{f}_{hj} - \theta \var{f}_{ij} = \param{b}_j \qquad  j \in V
      \end{align*}

   In the above balance equation, associated to node :math:`j`, the
   flow going out from the node, assumed to be in US$, is simply
   summed as usual; however, the flow entering the node includes the
   special case of a flow from a € node, :math:`i` to :math:`j` and,
   thus, a multiplication factor is introduced. This
   situation can be generalized to the case in which several
   entering arcs carry flows which need a transformation before
   entering node :math:`j`. 
   Again, the model remains a linear one, although no more a network
   flow one and, in general, the integrality property does not hold
   anymore.
   
5. The flow is assumed to be stationary; 
   this means that a constant quantity is "flowing" along every arc
   and there is no dynamics: flows are constant over time. Sometimes
   this is not desirable and we would like to model flows which vary
   in time. We will see later, in section
   :ref:`Dynamic Flows<section:dynamic-networks>`, how to modify the basic model in
   order to deal with this situation 
   
An example of a general model for the minimum cost flow problem
is given in the following figure: 

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
   \newcommand{\tvar}[1]{{\color{red}{\small{\mathbf{#1}}}}}
   \newcommand{\tparam}[1]{{\color{blue}{#1}}}
   \newcommand{\tset}[1]{\textsc{#1}}
   \node[vertex] (s) at  (0,2) [label=above:{\tiny{180}}] {$s$};
   \node[vertex] (P1) at (4,4) {P1};
   \node[vertex] (P2) at (4,2) {P2};
   \node[vertex] (P3) at (4,0) {P3};
   \node[vertex] (D1) at (8,5) [label=above:{\tiny{-120}}]{D1};
   \node[vertex] (D2) at (8,-1) [label=above:{\tiny{-60}}]{D2};
   \node[vertex] (i) at (2,-2) [label=above:{\tiny{$b_i$}}] {$i$};
   \node[vertex] (j) at (6,-2) [label=above:{\tiny{$b_j$}}]{$j$};
   \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\inf/\sup in {s/P1/11/0/100,
   s/P2/13/0/200,
   s/P3/10/0/100,
   P1/D1/3/0/$\infty$,   P2/D1/1/0/$\infty$,

   \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost,\inf,\sup}} (\fin);
   \end{tikzpicture}

In this figure, the problem is graphically represented, including all
data: above each node the balance is reported, with the convention
that nothing is written above nodes with zero balance. On each arch we
represent the unit cost, the lower and the upper bound on the flow.

Solving this example with a Linear Optimization software the optimal
flow turns out to be:

========================================
Applications of minimum cost flow models
========================================

:application: :index:`Production and distribution`

   Logistics, and, in particular, distribution, is one of the fields
   where the minimum cost flow model finds 
   many applications.
   As an example, consider a  set of plants, each with a given
   maximum production capacity and a set of distributors; consider also a
   set of  customers, whose demand for the product is assumed to be
   known.

   In a situation like this one, we would like to plan both
   production as well as transportation in order to minimize the total
   costs. Production might have different costs, depending on the
   producing plant; transportation, also, has a cost which depends
   both on the producer's location as well as on the customer's one.
   Reconsider the example of the preceding paragraph:

   .. tikz::
   
      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
      \newcommand{\tvar}[1]{{\color{red}{\small{\mathbf{#1}}}}}
      \newcommand{\tparam}[1]{{\color{blue}{#1}}}
      \newcommand{\tset}[1]{\textsc{#1}}
      \node[vertex] (s) at  (0,2) [label=above:{\tiny{180}}] {$s$};
      \node[vertex] (P1) at (4,4) {P1};
      \node[vertex] (P2) at (4,2) {P2};
      \node[vertex] (P3) at (4,0) {P3};
      \node[vertex] (D1) at (8,5) [label=above:{\tiny{-120}}]{D1};
      \node[vertex] (D2) at (8,-1) [label=above:{\tiny{-60}}]{D2};
      \node[vertex] (i) at (2,-2) [label=above:{\tiny{$b_i$}}] {$i$};
      \node[vertex] (j) at (6,-2) [label=above:{\tiny{$b_j$}}]{$j$};
      \foreach \ini/\fin/\cost/\inf/\sup in {s/P1/10/0/100,
      s/P2/13/0/200,
      s/P3/10/0/100,
      P1/D1/3/0/$\infty$,   P2/D1/1/0/$\infty$,
      P2/D2/1/0/$\infty$,
      P3/D1/5/0/$\infty$,
      P3/D2/3/0/$\infty$,
      i/j/$\tparam{c}_{ij}$/\tparam{L}$_{ij}$/\tparam{U}$_{ij}$}
      \draw[arc] (\ini) --node[above,sloped]{\tiny{\cost,\inf,\sup}} (\fin);
      \end{tikzpicture}

   We might consider the example as a production/transportation case:
   node :math:`s` is a decision node, from which production orders are
   issued. Each production order consists of a quantity to be produced
   from a specific producer (P1, P2, P3). The capacity on *production arcs* :math:`(s,P1),
   (s,P2), (s,P3)` are the maximum production capacities of the three
   plants (100, 200, 100, respectively). The costs associated to each of
   these arc
   are production costs: P1 and P3 produce at 10€ per unit, while P2 has a
   production cost of 13€. Arcs from P1, P2, P3 to D1 and D2 can be
   thought of as *transportation arcs*, with unlimited capacity (in
   this example) but
   different unit costs, raging from 1 per unit out of producer P2, to 5
   per unit in two links from the other producers. The balance of nodes
   D1 and D2 represent demand, while an equivalent balance, of opposite
   sign, is associated to the start node :math:`s`.
   
   It might seem that in this model flows of different kinds are present
   (production orders, finished good transportation):
   however, we can consider each flow as an order (from the producers to
   the customer). There is no distinction among flows, as any destination
   can be satisfied with flows from any of the connected nodes. 
   
   This model shows how it is possible to model two important decisions
   (production and transportation) by means of a single model which, in this case,
   is a network flow one. Being able to solve this global problem can be a
   great advantage, as decisions are taken in a non myopic way:
   traditionally, first production would be allocated to existing plants,
   minimizing production costs and then products would be shipped at
   minimum cost to destinations, thus taking the two decisions in
   different, separated, stages. In this example,  minimizing just
   production costs would lead to produce all 180 parts in plants P1 and
   P3, possibly 90 each (but any other combination not exceeding
   production capacity would cost the same).
   Taking into account that shipping costs from P1 are 3 towards D1
   and 5 towards D2, a slightly less myopic solution  would be to produce
   100 at P1 and 80 at P2, with a total production cost 1,800€. From
   there, transportation costs are: :math:`3 \times 100 + 5 \times 20 + 3
   \times 60 = 580`, with total cost 2,380€. On the other hand, the
   optimal solution reported has a total cost 2,360€, which is only
   slightly more convenient; although the difference is small, the
   structure of the solution is quite radically different and it is not
   difficult to see that in more complex production/transportation
   applications, the difference between a solution found by optimizing
   single stages in the process may be arbitrarily worse than the optimal one.

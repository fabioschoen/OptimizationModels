Product Mix Models
==================

A field in which linear models find wide applicability is
that of decisions related to some aspects of the 
production process. In particular,  :index:`production mix` problems
correspond to the case in which it is necessary to choose, among many
possible  products, the quantity to produce, taking into account the
availability of some scarce  resources (like, e.g.,
available workers). An assumption  frequently made in some of these models, is
that of operating in a market in which the supply of finished products
always finds a suitable demand in the market. This assumption might
however be somewhat relaxed without necessarily having to include
stochastic models of the demand.

The basic problem therefore reduces to choosing the quantities to
produce to maximize the total
gain, within the  constraints imposed by the availability
of resources. The components of these models are:
 
#. a set of possible products;
#. a set of available resources;
#. the quantity of each resource required for the production of each product;
#. the net gain for each product. 
 
Also in this model we can highlight the basic elements
of all optimization models and, in particular,

* index sets: the set of possible products and the set of resources;
* parameters: the unit gain for each product (a parameter
  indexed by the set of products), the  availability of resources
  (a numeric parameter indexed by the set of resources), a table
  in which, for each product and for each resource, the quantity of
  resource needed to produce one unit of this product is given; this
  parameter is indeed a
  matrix indexed by the Cartesian product between the set of
  resources and the set of products; other parameters may also be
  present, such as lower and upper limits on the quantity to be
  produced;
  
* decision variables:
  the quantities to be produced, a vector of variables indexed by
  the set of products.
  It is worth observing that there is only a difference between
  parameters and variables:  variables are under the control
  of the decision maker, while parameters are considered 
  known and constant, and cannot be modified by the solver; 
* constraints: 
    
  * lower and upper limits on the quantities to be produced
    (two sets of constraints indexed by the set of products);
  * maximum resource consumption (a set of constraints
    corresponding to the different types of resources). 

* an objective function; in the example we assume that we wish
  to maximize the  total gain.
    
It may be useful to put  the elements of the model in
a scheme.

	\]


Of course this is an overly simplified model of a realistic situation;
by the way:

.. warning::
   
   the above statement is true for all of the models described in this
   volume!
   
Several deliberately simplified modeling assumptions are made in
order to keep models easy to understand without unnecessary
details. In realistic situations, complex models will be built by
joining parts of different models.

In this product mix example, many
additional aspects might be considered, like, e.g.:

* fixed costs: the decision regarding the production
  of a particular piece must sometimes be based on the presence of
  a fixed cost to be paid just to start production. As an example, starting
  production  might require "warming up" a machine or a plant until it
  is ready to produce, thus consuming costly energy; in other
  situations,  hours
  should be initially devoted to training. This modeling aspect
  will be seen in the 
  chapter on :ref:`Fixed Charge models<sect:fixedcharge>` and will require the introduction of
  binary variables;
 
* dynamic models: demand  forecasts do not concern a single period, but a
  set of consecutive production periods, linked together through
  the introduction of an inventory. These models will be introduced in
  the section on :ref:`Multi Period Models<section:multi-prod>`.
 
* stochastic models:  some parameters,
  like, most notably, the demand for a certain product,  can be
  seen as realizations of random variables.
  Even when dealing with make-to-order systems, in which production is
  started based on known purchase orders, randomness is always present when
  dealing with future planning periods. And, of course, when the company
  operates in a make-to-stock way, demand needs to be somewhat
  anticipated and, thus, estimated. 

  In many situations in which uncertainty is present  decision makers 
  simply replace random variables with an estimate, usually the
  expected value or the most likely one. However, optimization
  approaches do exist which are capable of taking into account uncertainty in an
  explicit way, thus accounting, e.g., not only for expected values but
  also for the variance of random variables. A very short and simplified
  introduction to these models will be presented in
  Chapter :ref:`sect:plstoc`, where it will be shown how far from
  optimality   a policy might be when summarizing a stochastic quantity
  by its expected value.
  

  :application: :index:`Choosing among different production modes`
   
  Sometimes a product mix model
  is  not used to decide, among several
  *products*, which ones to produce and in which
  quantities. Frequently, the quantity to be produced is fixed and
  known; the decision problem might in this case be that of choosing
  among multiple *production modes*, instead. In other words, we are not
  required to decide how much to produce, but how much of the production
  should be allocated to different plants, with different resource
  consumption, different resource availability and possibly different
  production costs and, thus, gains. Formally the problem is identical to the
  standard one. As an example, consider
  steel rods of different diameters to be produced using different machines. The
  available machines can produce material of different diameters, with
  production rates and  costs which depend on the machine.

  The  data file below is an example of this situation.

  .. literalinclude:: AMPL/steel.dat
     :caption: steel.dat
     :language: ampl
 
  Considering the data in the example, the resources in this case are 
  machines which differ one another  for their availability (hours
  per week) and production speed: in this example the
  actual availability doesn't just depend on the available hours,
  but also on the speed of the machine. So, for example, if the speed 
  of machine 1 is  150 meters per minute, in order to produce one
  meter  :math:`1/(60 \cdot 150)` hours would be required. In this
  case, the consumption
  of each resource does not depend on the product itself, but on the
  machine type. There is also another special type of dependence: 
  not every  machine, in fact, is capable of producing  all  product types.
  As an example, product type A can only be worked
  on machine 1 (its diameter is within the interval 3 to 6 which
  characterizes this machine), while product type B (diameter 6) can be
  produced both on the second or on third machine, but not on the
  first one. The
  net gain  resulting from the decision to produce a type of
  rod on a specific machine is obtained as  the difference between the revenue
  associated with this rod and the cost of using the machine.
  If we wish to formalize this model, the following scheme might be a guide.

     * :math:`\param{Consumption}_{rp}`: amount of  resource :math:`r \in \set{Resources}`
       needed to produce a unit of product :math:`p \in \set{Products}`; this
       parameter can be an input data, or it can be computed as a function
       of other parameters, as in the case of the included file,  where
       it is based on the  production speed of each machine;

	  \begin{align*}
          \param{Gain}_{rp} = \param{Revenue}_p  - \param{Cost}_r \times \param{Consumption}_{rp}
	  \end{align*}
	 
     for  :math:`p \in \set{Products}`, :math:`r \in \set{Resources}`,
     provided that  :math:`Match(p, r)` is true, i.e., that product
     :math:`p` can
     be obtained on machine :math:`r` ;

     :model:`Variables:`

     * :math:`\var{x}_{rp}`: quantity of   :math:`p \in \set{Products}`
       to be produced on machine  :math:`r \in \set{Resources}`;

	  \param{MinQty}_p \leq \sum_{r \in \set{Resources}: Match(p, r)}
          \var{x}_{rp} \leq \param{MaxQty}_p
	  \end{align*}
    
       for each :math:`p \in \set{Products}`. 
     *  Resource availability:

	.. math::
	   :nowrap:
	   
	   \[
	   \sum_{p \in \set{Products}: Match(p, r) }
	   \param{Consumption}_{rp} \var{x}_{rp} \leq \param{Avail}_r
	   \]
	   
	for each  :math:`r \in \set{Resources}`
    
  |
     :model:`Objective:` Maximize the total gain:
  |

     * Gain maximization:

       .. math::
	  :nowrap:
	   
	  \[
	  \max \sum_{p, r: Match(p, r)} \param{Gain}_{rp} \var{x}_{rp}
	  \]

  It can be seen that the structure of this model is  quite close to that of the
  generic product mix; some variants had to be introduced just in order to
  take into account the characteristics of  different machine and compatibility issues.

-------------------------------
Dual of the product mix problem
-------------------------------

Consider a simplified version of the
product mix model introduced before:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_p \param{Gain}_p \, \var{x}_p & \\
   \sum_p \param{Consumption}_{rp} \, \var{x}_p & \leq \param{Avail}_r & \forall \, r \\
   \var{x}_p & \geq 0 & \forall \, p
   \end{align*}

The dual of this problem might be easily derived, either by
reformulating it as a standard linear optimization model, or by
considering it as the dual of a standard one; in this case the only
"non standard" aspect of the problem is the non negativity of the
variables, which can be traced back to a primal with inequalities in
place of equations.  
Formally the dual of turns out to be:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_r \param{Avail}_r \mathvar{\lambda}_r & \\
   \sum_r \param{Consumption}_{rp} \mathvar{\lambda}_r & \geq \param{Gain}_p & \forall \, p \\
   \mathvar{\lambda}_r & \geq 0 & \forall \, r
   \end{align*}

This problem lends itself to an economic interpretation. 
A work agency would like  to buy  the available resources from the
producer. The agency will try
to purchase all the available  resources of the company and will
propose a unit price
:math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_r` for  resource :math:`r`, trying to  minimize the
total cost.
In order to  convince the company to release  manpower and  other
resources, the proposed  prices  must be
competitive. The dual constraint associated with product :math:`p`,
represents the fact that,  if the manufacturer decides to sell the
resources requested to produce one unit of :math:`p` to the dual agency, the
revenue will be at least equal to the  unit gain.

Duality  implies that there will be no
advantage for either actor, neither the producer nor the agency:
optimal values are identical and a  strictly competitive price (in the
dual) will be allowed
only for products types which will not be produced in the  optimal mix.
 
As a simple illustrative example consider the following data.

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \[
   \begin{array}{lrrrrrrrl}
   \text{prod:}& \text{1} & \text{2} & \text{3} & \text{4} & \text{5} & \text{6} & \text{7} & \\ \hline
   \text{carpentry} & 7 & 5 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 12 & 15 & \leq 2000 \\
   \text{coating} & 2 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & \leq 1500\\ 
   \text{assembly} & 2 & 2 & 4 & 7 & 9 & 15 & 18 & \leq 1700\\
   \text{control} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 2 &  \leq 300 \\
   \text{packaging} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & \leq 500 \\ \hline
   \text{Gain} & 10 & 18 & 20 & 25 & 27 & 28 & 35 & \max
   \end{array}
   \]

It is readily seen, possibly through a suitable implementation, that an
optimal solution consists of producing 200 units of product 2 and 100
of product 5, with  a total gain 6300. The resources "carpentry"
and "control" are used at full capacity.

Solving the dual, the variable associated to carpentry gets a price
1.8, the one associated to control 9, all the others being fixed to
0. With this price, while there is no strict convenience, for the
product mixer, with respect to the production of products 2 and 5, apparently
there might be a gain for what concerns other products. As an
example, selling the resources needed to produce one unit of product 1
will generate a revenue of 21.6, significantly higher than 10, the
unit gain on that product. However, the producer has no interest in this
product, as it does not appear in the optimal solution.  

We note in passing that duality helps in gaining confidence on the
solution reported by a numerical solver: if we plug the above
solutions in the primal and dual respectively, we can immediately
check  that both are feasible and satisfy complementarity, without the
necessity of going through the computation of a numerical solver.
 
We observe that duality is
an extremely powerful *modeling*, and not just *computational*,
tool. Whenever a problem which models a real situation is formulated,
its dual might  be interpreted in the same context and sometimes
gives rise to interesting models. Finding a reasonable dual
interpretation  might not be easy, but is surely worth the effort.

Dynamic flows
=============

The applications of the generic minimum cost flow model considered up
to now correspond to *static* flows, i.e. to flows that do not vary in time.
It is sometimes interesting to consider a generalization 
which allows for *dynamic* flows. This generalization will be
presented here for the discrete time case.
A simple technique for modeling
dynamic flows consists in replicating the nodes of the graph over time, a copy for
each time instant. Each node of 
the replicated graph will contain a label with the time instant
associated to the original one.
Arcs connecting nodes with different time labels can be thought of as
flows out from a node at a time instant which will enter another node
at a future time instant.
If it is assumed that the travel time between nodes :math:`i` and
:math:`j`  is  :math:`\Delta_{ij}` time units,
then in the dynamic graph there will be arcs between nodes labeled
:math:`i,t`  and nodes  :math:`j,t+\Delta_{ij}`. 
The interpretation of a flow along one of these arcs will be  that of
a flow unit that was in  :math:`i` 
at time  :math:`t`  and will arrive in  :math:`j` at time  :math:`t + \Delta_{ij}`.

   :application:  :index:`Safe evacuation from a building`

   In this application we consider a simplified problem connected with
   emergency planning in buildings.
   Given a graph representing possible paths in a building, with nodes
   associated to rooms, intersections and exits, we would like to
   evaluate the maximum number of persons in source nodes who can safely
   proceed towards an exit in a given amount of time, given travel times
   along arcs as well as capacity.
   Consider, as a very simplified example, the following situation:
   
   .. tikz::
   
      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
      \foreach \x / \y / \name  in {0/1/s,1/2/A,1/0/B,2/1/t}
      \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
      \foreach \source /  \dest / \capac / \time in {s/A/2/1,s/B/8/2,A/B/3/2,A/t/2/1,B/t/2/1}
      \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {\capac;\time} (\dest);
      \node[vertex] (i) at (0,-1)  {$i$};
      \node[vertex] (j) at (2,-1) {$j$};
      \path[arc] (i) -- node[weight] {$Fmax_{ij};\Delta_{ij}$} (j);
      \end{tikzpicture}

   This network can be "unfolded" in time. Assume we would like to
   check how many units of flow, as a maximum, can be safely taken to
   the terminal node in, say, 4 time units. Then, a 4 "frames" network
   can be defined as follows:

   .. tikz::
   
      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.1,rotate=-90]
      \foreach \x / \y / \name  in {0/1/s,1/2/A,1/0/B,2/1/t} {
      \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
      \node[vertex] (\name1) at (\x+3,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name1}};
      \node[vertex] (\name2) at (\x+6,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name2}};
      \node[vertex] (\name3) at (\x+9,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name3}};
      \node[vertex] (\name4) at (\x+12,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name4}};
      }
      \node[vertex] (T) at (6,4) {T};
      \foreach \source /  \dest / \capac  / \bnd in
      {s/A1/2/45,s1/A2/2/45,s2/A3/2/45,s3/A4/2/45,s/B2/8/-45,s1/B3/8/-45,s2/B4/8/-45,A/B2/3/-15,A1/B3/3/-15,A3/B4/3/-15,
      A/t1/2/25,A1/t2/2/25,A2/t3/2/25,A3/t4/2/25,B/t1/2/-45,B1/t2/2/-45,B2/t3/2/-45,B3/t4/2/-45}
      \path (\source) edge[->,bend left=\bnd] node[weight] {\capac}
      (\dest);
      \foreach \source / \dest in {s/s1,s1/s2,s2/s3,s3/s4,A/A1,A1/A2,A2/A3,A3/A4,B/B1,B1/B2,B2/B3,B3/B4}
      \path (\source) edge[thick,dashed,->,bend right=10,blue] (\dest);
      \foreach \source / \dest in {t1/T//90,t2/T//90,t3/T//90,t4/T}
      \path (\source) edge[thick,dashed,->] (\dest);
      \end{tikzpicture}

   In order to determine the  maximum amount of people located at node :math:`s`
   who might be able  to exit the building in a specific amount of time, we
   can  solve the maximum flow problem  in the expanded  graph
   shown above, using  node
   :math:`S = s1` as source and a fictitious node :math:`T` as
   destination. This node is connected to each replica of the original
   terminal node in different time instants.
   In the graph, the
   labels on each  arc represents the maximum capacity.

   There are
   two types of arc:

   * arcs  between nodes with different names
     which  represent flows both in space and in time
   * arcs   connecting two nodes with the same name in consecutive
     time instants which represent flow units which do not leave the
     node during a specific time instant.

   As an example, the arc between node :math:`(s, 1)` and :math:`(B, 2)` with
   capacity 2 represents a maximum flow of 2 units which,
   starting from the source at time 1, reaches  node :math:`B`
   in time instant 2. The arc 
   connecting :math:`(s, 1)` with :math:`(s, 2)` instead represents a part of the flow
   which, after time instant 1, remains in node :math:`s`.
   
   Any implementation of the maximum flow model for this special case
   needs some non standard definitions in order to allow for an easy
   definition of the network. In practice it is reasonable to assume
   that the data contains the description of the graph and the time
   horizon, and building the expanded network is left to the modeling
   language itself.  As an example, consider the following data
   describing a more elaborated situation. Here a time horizon of 5 is
   chosen and a network with 6 arcs is defined:
   
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/evacuation.dat
      :caption: evacuation.dat
      :language: ampl

   A possibility for the model is the following, where we can observe
   the definition of the expanded network as well as the
   re-implementation of the maximum flow problem:
   
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/evacuation.mod
      :caption: evacuation.mod
      :language: ampl

   Running  a linear solver on this example generates an optimal
   solution of value 10 with the following flows:

   .. code-block:: ampl

      S 1 s 1   10
      s 1 A 2    3
      s 1 B 4    3
      s 1 s 2    4
      A 2 B 3    2
      A 2 t 3    1
      A 3 A 4    1
      A 3 B 4    2
      A 3 t 4    1
      A 4 t 5    1
      B 3 t 4    2
      B 4 t 5    5
      s 2 A 3    4
      t 3 t 4    1
      t 4 T 5    4
      t 5 T 5    6

   The example shown here is extremely simplified; in a realistic application
   other fundamental aspects should be included. In particular  it
   would be advisable that out of each node the
   whole flow is
   routed along a single path and not split into different flows.
   This is needed in order to be able to put clear and not ambiguous
   directions to follow when leaving a node.

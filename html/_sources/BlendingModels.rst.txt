Blending Models
===============

Blending models deal with situations in which some raw material has to
be  mixed in order to obtain a blend with specific quality
requirements. An example has been already presented in the
introduction for the case of blending aluminum from scrap (see
:ref:`application: Blending aluminum scrap<blending_al_scrap>`).  
 
The following table summarizes some of the most typical applications
of blending models; each application is identified by the input
"materials", the quality to be taken into consideration, the desired
output.

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}   
   \begin{array}{ll}
   inputs & quality \\ \hline
   foods & proteins, vitamins, fats, carbohydrates, \dots  \\
   feed & proteins, vitamins, fats, carbohydrates, \dots 
   \\
   crude\, oil & octane\, number, volatility,
   lead \\
   scrap, pure\, metals & Fe, Si,
   Mg, Mn, Al, \dots  \\
   grapes & vintage, region\, of\, origin, grape\, variety 
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}

A  classic and well--known example of blending  is the so-called
:index:`diet problem`; 
this is also the first example of a non trivial 
linear optimization problem  solved by means of the simplex method
(see :cite:`dantzig_linear_1963`, :cite:`george_b_dantzig_diet_1990`).

.. note::
   In the early days of linear optimization, the father of the simplex
   method, George Dantzig, solved a  problem originally proposed to him by George
   Stigler (1982 Nobel prize winner in Economics) in the following
   form:
   
   *"For a moderately active
   man weighing 154 pounds, how much of each of 77 foods should be eaten
   on a daily basis so that the man's intake of nine nutrients will be
   at least equal to the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) suggested
   by the National Research Council in 1943, with the cost of the diet
   being minimal?"*

A list of available foods is given, along with associated
characteristics, like  purchase price and 
nutritional characteristics (vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, fat,
calories, iron, ...). It is required to find  a  minimum cost food blend 
which satisfies
nutritional requirements (upper and/or lower bounds on each nutritional characteristics). 
A blending  model specialized for diets can be represented as follows:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/diet.mod
   :caption: diet.mod
   :language: ampl


It can be immediately seen that, apart from some name changes included
to make
the model more readable, this is exactly the blending problem
introduced in section :ref:`Structured linear optimization models`. The main
difference is that, usually, in diet problems there is no constraint
on the total quantity to be produced. However, a similar constraint
might be needed when planning blends different from human food.
In the above model some parameters default to 0, for lower bounds, or
to :math:`\infty`, for upper bounds. An infinite upper bound means
that the corresponding constraint is absent from the model.

Usually, the objective in blending models is
cost minimization; however,  sometimes the objective  might be of a qualitative nature:
for example, in a diet model, we might wish to minimize
caloric contents, or, in  aluminum scrap blending, we might wish to
minimize  iron.  It's easy to modify the objective by suitably
changing the cost parameter.

When blending certain quantities of materials, each of them
additively  contributes to the quality of the blend.
E.g., if   100g of a given kind of pasta contains 73g  of
carbohydrates and 14g  of proteins,  
while  100g of Parmesan cheese contains 15g of carbohydrate and 28g
of proteins, in a blend of 100g of pasta and 20g of cheese the
carbohydrate contents will be

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \[
   \frac{100}{100} \times 73 + \frac{20}{100} \times 15 = 76\textrm{g}
   \]
   
while for what concerns proteins the blend will contain

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \[
   \frac{100}{100} \times 14 + \frac{20}{100} \times 28 = 19.6\textrm{g}
   \]

Some attention needs to be paid for the cases in which
quality requirements are expressed not in terms of absolute quantities
but of percentages. As an example, in an aluminum bending problem we
usually require that iron is no more than 3%. Of course if a
specific quantity, say 2000 kg, has to be produced, this can be
readily transformed into an an absolute requirement: the blend should
contain at most 60 kg of iron (3% of 2000). However when the
quantity to be produced is itself a variable, the exact requirements
cannot be determined *a priori*. 

When the lower and upper bounds :math:`\param{minQual},
\param{maxQual}` refer to a percentage, denoting by :math:`\var{x}`
the main variable of the problem and by :math:`\param{Q}` the matrix
containing the composition of foods, a formulation of the quality requirement
might be:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \param{minQual}_i \leq \sum_{j \in \set{FOODS}} \param{Q}_{ij}
   \frac{\var{x}_j} {\sum_{k \in \set{FOODS}} 
   \var{x}_k} \leq \param{maxQual}_i 
   \end{align*}

However, in  this constraint some variables appear in the denominator
and, therefore, the model is no more linear, something that, if
at all possible, is strongly advisable to avoid. This constraint
can be  easily  transformed into a linear equivalent one by
multiplying both members by the denominator:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \param{minQual}_i \sum_{k \in \set{FOODS}} \var{x}_k \leq \sum_{j
   \in \set{FOODS}} \param{Q}_{ij} \var{x}_j 
   \leq \param{maxQual}_i \sum_{k \in \set{FOODS}} \var{x}_k
   \end{align*}
   
or, equivalently,

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j \in \set{FOODS}} (\param{Q}_{ij} - \param{minQual}_i) \var{x}_j & \geq 0 \\
   \sum_{j \in \set{FOODS}} (\param{maxQual}_i- \param{Q}_{ij})
   \var{x}_j & \geq 0.
   \end{align*}
   
The original Stigler  diet model included a list of 77 foods
and nine types of nutrients, and was considered in order to find the
minimal cost diet for subsistence. The diet problem was resolved by hand by a
group of nine researchers in 1947; its solution required 120 man-days of
calculation.  This model can
now be solved to optimality  in a fraction of a second on any personal
computer with free open source solvers.
 
A  data file with some of the foods and the nutritional specifications from the original
paper by Stigler  is reported in the following piece of code.
Of course the example has the sole purpose of illustrating the
modeling methodology and should not be considered as
a realistic example of a diet model. As Stigler wrote on his paper, 
"No one recommends these diets for anyone, let alone everyone".
   
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/StiglerSmallDiet.dat
   :caption: StiglerSmallDiet.dat
   :language: ampl

Solving the diet problem with these data produces
the following result:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/StiglerSmallDiet.out
   :caption: StiglerSmallDiet.out
   :language: ampl

The minimum cost diet has a  total yearly
cost of 39.6889US$ (a very low price indeed, even considering it is
referred to 1939).

From the above table the nutritional contents of this "diet" can be
observed along with the imposed lower bounds; it is evident that some
nutrients are expensive and, thus, in the optimal diet they appear at
their lower bound (Calcium, Calories, Vitamins A and C); others, on the
contrary, are abundant in the diet, significantly over the lower
bound. 

Diets built in this way suffer, typically, from a large set of
defects. Sometimes it happens that a food appears in too large daily
quantities (something we can easily put a remedy to by imposing an
upper bound on the variables); frequently, as this case confirms, 
only a very small set of different foods appear in the solution.
Moreover,
it is usually undesirable to have non-integer values in the solution, as
it is not possible to buy fractions of a single unit  for each
food. This kind of constraints usually require the introduction of
binary variables, a topic we will introduce later in the chapter devoted
to :ref:`Mixed Integer Linear Models`.
     
All of the above are constraints which we would like to add to the
basic model in order to obtain an acceptable diet. By the way, this
example shows that modeling is usually performed in iterative
incremental steps: a simple model is formulated and solved, than the
solution is critically analyzed and more refined models are possibly
built until, eventually, the solution turns out to satisfy all of the requirements.

Consider the toy diet example below:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/diet.dat
   :caption:
   :lines: 1-10

...

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/diet.dat
   :lines: 64-108

...

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/diet.dat
   :lines: 201-227

...

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/diet.dat
   :lines: 278-280

The minimum cost diet turns out to be

.. code-block:: python
		
   Buy [*] :=
     "1% Lowfat Milk"   1.84868
     "Cheerios"   2.26212
     "Cheeseburger"   1.83187
     "Chunky Chicken Salad"   0.0304813
     "Hamburger"   0.24392
     "Honey"  15.511
     "Orange Juice"   0.408322
     "Sweet 'N Sour Sauce"   4.32537
   totalcost = 5.367956845


Even in a toy example like this one we can immediately see that this
proposal is not acceptable; let us, for example, add a maximum of 2
portions per food. The result changes as follows

.. code-block:: python
		
   Buy [*] :=
     "Barbeque Sauce"  2
     "Cheerios"  1.81106
     "Chocolate Shake"  2
     "Chunky Chicken Salad"  0.212507
     "H-C Orange Drink (large)"  0.73578
     "Hamburger"  1.82403
     "Honey"  2
     "Orange Juice"  0.326808
     "Strawberry Shake"  0.189541
     "Sweet "N Sour Sauce"  2
   totalcost = 7.168394112

As it can be  easily guessed,
additional or more strict  constraints usually imply a cost
increase. It is also worth observing that the request of an upper bound
led to a modification not only in the quantity of the foods of the
original solution, but also in the composition of the optimal diet,
with new foods entering the blend.

Imposing now integrality we obtain

.. code-block:: python
		
   Buy [*] :=
     "1% Lowfat Milk"  1
     "Barbeque Sauce"  2
     "Cheerios"  1
     "Chocolate Shake"  1
     "Hamburger"  1
     "Honey"  1
     "Orange Juice"  1
     "Strawberry Shake"  2
     "Sweet "N Sour Sauce"  2
     "Wheaties"  2
   totalcost =  8.45

with a  cost 8.45, which, again, is higher than the previous one.
We observe that the integer solution is not obtained by 
rounding the fractional ones, but by a quite different mix.
  
The model presented here is so elementary  to be, in
practice, of little practical use; however, it may be 
the basis for building more
realistic ones. It is worth recalling that a slightly enriched version
of the diet problem has been used, with success, in :cite:`ABW2022` to
optimize food baskets for distribution to fight hunger. In cooperation
with th World Food Program, a tool based also on the diet model has
saved millions of lives.

One of the constraints that often appears in real diets
is  a limitation on the amount of
some types of fats, both in absolute terms or as a percentage of other
kinds of fat. When the requirement is absolute, then it can be modeled
as above; when however it is relative, some care has to be taken.
As an example, in a balanced diet it might be required that
the calories from fat do not exceed 30% of the total calories.
Based on available  data on the amount of calories from
fat and the total for each food, the constraint
is easily expressed as a linear inequality:


.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j \in \set{FOODS}} \param{CaloriesFromFat}_{j} \var{x}_{j}
   \leq \frac{30}{100} \sum_{j \in \set{FOODS}} \param{Calories}_{j}
   \var{x}_{j}
   \end{align*}
 
Many other nutritional requirements can be expressed in a similar way;
however, it is not always possible, within the framework of linear
optimization, to extend the model to account for different
requirements. As an example, it frequently happens that the optimal
diet consists of only a tiny number of different foods. This is a
trivial consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Optimization
and is connected with the fact that the solution returned by most
solvers is a *basic* feasible solution. Imposing a threshold on the
number of different foods  in the diet cannot be made in a linear
optimization model, although it is quite easily done with the
introduction of binary variables, as we will see.
In chapter :ref:`Mixed Integer Linear Models` we will present modeling
techniques  which 
allow for the  inclusion of similar constraints, as well as other, more general, logical ones.
Constraints like, e.g., "if the diet prescribes to use food A, then it must not contain food B" or "either A
or B should be in the diet, but not both", or "either food A is
not part of the optimal diet, or its quantity must be at least 2 portions" can indeed be
formulated through linear models with binary variables and "logical
constraints".
Suitable models will be presented in
section :ref:`Using binary variables in logical constraints`. 
 
The example just described might also be extended  over a time horizon: 
in this case each variable  will have an additional index
associated to each day or time period;  there might be constraints on quality related
to each single day as well as constraints on longer periods (e.g., the
total calories  should not be more than, say, :math:`3\,000` per
day, while they should be no more than :math:`2\,500`, on average, per
week). In a multi-period scenario, moreover, there can be different
costs per day or different availability of foods. 

It is also important to observe that, frequently, in blending problems
costs are not linear but *piece-wise linear*, with decreasing slope. This
way discounts for large quantities are included in the model.  A brief
introduction on modeling techniques for piece-wise linear functions
will be presented in section :ref:`Minimax problems`.

Another observation concerns data quality:
frequently most data
(nutritional contents, chemical composition) are just
estimates of real data, corresponding  to the composition of an "average"
unit of material or food. The actual contents can be considered as the realization
of a random variable.
When some information is available or can be assumed on the 
probability distribution of these data, 
stochastic models can be considered, in which
probabilistic constraints can be added. An example might be the
requirement that the contents of iron in a blend should be no more
than 2% with probability at least 98%. A very short introduction to the
modeling aspects of probabilistic
constraints will be given in section :ref:`sect:plstoc`. Taking
into account the distribution of data, and, in particular, variance,
can lead to much more robust and reasonable decisions.

--------------------------
Dual of  blending problems
--------------------------

The structure of many linear blending problems
is that of a standard linear optimization problems, with equations for
quality contents and, possibly, an equation associated to the quantity to be
produced. In formulae:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_j \param{c}_j \var{x}_j &  \\
   \sum_j \param{A}_{ij} \var{x}_j & = b_i  & \forall\,i\\
   \sum_j \var{x}_j & = 1 \\
   \var{x}_j & \geq 0& \forall\,j
   \end{align*}
   
where :math:`\param{c}_j` are  unit costs, :math:`\param{A}_{ij}` represents
the percentage of chemical element :math:`i` contained in a unit of
scrap :math:`j`, and the total quantity produced is assumed to be one unit -
see the beginning of this chapter for a description of the problem.

Assume for now that the equation on the total quantity above is redundant
and can be eliminated without changing the set of feasible
solutions. By this we mean that this equation is a linear combination
of the other equations in the model. The most frequent case is when
the composition matrix :math:`\param{A}` contains a complete chemical analysis, i.e. its rows are
associated to all chemical elements in the blend. In practice this is
the case when

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_i \param{A}_{ij} &= \sum_i \param{b}_i = 1 & \forall\,j 
   \end{align*}


In this case the blending problem  can be represented as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_j \param{c}_j \var{x}_j & \\
   \sum_j \param{A}_{ij} \var{x}_j & = \param{b}_i \\
   \var{x}_j & \geq 0
   \end{align*}
 
The dual of this standard linear optimization  problem can be easily
found, associating a dual variable to  each chemical element:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_i \param{b}_i \var{\lambda}_i & \\
   \sum_i \param{A}_{ij} \var{\lambda}_i & \leq \param{c}_j  & \forall\,j 
   \end{align*}
   
In order to interpret this model it is useful to refer
to a numerical example. Consider a blending problem with the following
data:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   \begin{array}{lrrrrrrrrrr}
   &A&B&C&D&E&F&G&H&I&\text{request} \\  \hline
   \text{Pb}& 10 & 10 & 40 & 60 & 30 & 30 & 30 & 50 & 20 & = 40\\
   \text{Zn} & 10 & 30 & 50 & 30 & 30 & 40 & 20 & 40 & 30 & = 30 \\
   \text{Sn} & 80 & 60 & 10 & 10 & 40 & 30 & 50 & 10 & 50 & = 30 \\ \hline
   \text{Cost}&4.1 & 4.3 & 5.8 & 6.0 & 7.6 & 7.5 & 7.3 & 6.9 & 7.3 & \min
   \end{array}
   \]

The dual of this problem, in explicit form, is:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max 40 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}} + 30 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}} +
   30 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}} & \\
   10 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}} + 10 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}} + +
   80 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}} & \leq 4.1 & (A) \\
   10 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}} + 30 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}} + +
   60 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}} & \leq 4.3 & (B) \\
   \ldots & &\ldots \\
   20 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}} + 30 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}} + +
   50 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}} & \leq 7.3 & (I)
   \end{align*}

In order to proceed with an interpretation of this model, in the
context of blending,  notice  that the primal problem requires the
minimization of the blend cost. The objective function thus
represents a monetary value, e.g. €. From  strong duality
the optimal value of the dual problem, when it exists, is identical to
that of the primal; it is therefore quite reasonable to assume that
even for the dual objective function the unit of measurement is monetary.
The coefficients of the dual objective are
pure numbers (percentages of chemical elements), thus variables
:math:`\var{\lambda}` represent monetary values. We might
interpret  the dual as follows: an hypothetical producer of
pure metals wishes to fix the selling prices of Lead, Tin
and Zinc. Knowing that the buyer requires  40, 30 and
30 units of Lead, Zinc, Tin,
the manufacturer can assume  to be able
sell exactly 40 units  of Lead, 30 of Zinc and 30
of Tin. The objective therefore corresponds to the maximization of the
total revenue, given the prices of pure metal  :math:`\var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}}, \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}},
\var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}}`.
 
For what concerns the constraints, the first one is

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   10 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Pb}} + 10 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Zn}} +
   80 \var{\lambda}_{\texttt{Sn}} \leq 4.1
   \]

Assuming prices have been chosen for each pure metal, the left hand side
represents the cost of a blend composed of  
10% Lead, 10% Zinc, 80% Tin: this is the price of a blend
perfectly analogous to scrap A.
Thus this constraint represents a competitive price fixing for scrap A: the
manufacturer sets the price of pure  metals in such a way as to make it
competitive or  equivalent with respect to one unit of
type A scrap.
Similarly, the other inequalities constrain the prices of pure
metals to be set in order to be competitive with respect to each
available scrap.
Thus the dual of the blending problem is
the problem faced by a producer of pure chemical elements
who wishes to fix prices in such a way as to maximize the revenues
while keeping the cost of synthetic equivalents lower than or equal to
the market price for each scrap. 
So the manufacturer tries to
persuade the buyer to use  pure metals
by setting prices which apparently are competitive with those of
the scrap market. However, duality theory guarantees that the cost
of the optimal scrap blend is exactly equal to the maximum revenue of
the producer: there is a perfect balance between supply and demand,
of course as long as both players, the minimizer and
the maximizer, know the optimal strategy. 

From the complementary slackness theorem, it can also be observed that,
if a scrap is contained, at a non zero level, in an optimal blend,
the corresponding dual constraint should be satisfied with zero
slack (i.e., it should be *active*); but since the slack in the dual
corresponds to  the margin of the
manufacturer for that scrap, duality  implies that in the optimal solution,
for every scrap whose purchase is
worth, the manufacturer must fix the price in such a way that
the  margin is zero. It is therefore quite evident
that the optimal objectives will be identical: the manufacturer has the
possibility to set apparently competitive prices only
for materials that the blend purchaser would not buy at all.

Returning to the original blending problem in which  equation
:math:`\sum_j \var{x}_j=1` is included, we may find an interpretation in
the following way. Assume that the rows of :math:`\param{A}` (and of :math:`\param{b}`) 
*do not* sum to 1, otherwise the constraint would be
redundant. The linear optimization dual of the problem is now

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_i \param{b}_i \var{\lambda}_i  + \var{\mu}\\
   \sum_i \param{A}_{ij} \var{\lambda}_i + \var{\mu }& \leq \param{c}_j  & \forall\,j 
   \end{align*}
   
where a single dual variable :math:`\var{\mu}` has been introduced as the
Lagrange multiplier of the total request constraint. The original
problem can be re-written, in equivalent form, by substituting the
last equation with a linear combination:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_j \param{c}_j \var{x}_j & \\
   \sum_j \param{A}_{ij} \var{x}_j & = \param{b}_i \\
   \sum_j (1 - \sum_i \param{A}_{ij}) \var{x}_j & = 1 -\sum_i \param{b}_i \\
   \var{x}_j & \geq 0
   \end{align*}
   
The last equation corresponds to the chemical balance of the remaining elements in the
blend. The dual of this problem, introducing a variable
:math:`\var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1}` for the last equation, is

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_i \param{b}_i \var{\lambda}^\prime_i  + \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1} (1
   - \sum_i \param{b}_i)\\
     \sum_i \param{A}_{ij} \var{\lambda}^\prime_i + (1-\sum_i \param{A}_{ij}) \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1}& \leq \param{c}_j  & \forall\,j 
     \end{align*}
     
or, equivalently,

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_i \param{b}_i (\var{\lambda}^\prime_i- \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1})  + \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1} \\
   \sum_i \param{A}_{ij} (\var{\lambda}^\prime_i - \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1}) + \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1}& \leq \param{c}_j  & \forall\,j 
   \end{align*}

Comparing with the dual blending problem it is immediately seen that
these dual formulations are identical provided we assume

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{\mu} & = \var{\lambda}^\prime_{m+1} \\
   \var{\lambda}_i & = \var{\lambda}^\prime_i  -\var{\mu}
   \end{align*}

Thus the dual of the generic blending problem can be interpreted
exactly as before, provided that we associate a selling price also
to the "remainder", i.e. to a dummy chemical element which
corresponds to what remains, in each scrap analysis, to reach 100%
of the analysis.
This sell price is the dual multiplier associated to the total
requirement equation. 
The prices  of the ordinary chemical elements in the two
formulations just differ by this quantity.

----------------------
Dual of the diet model
----------------------

A diet model is a blending problem,
although in general 
there is no requirement on the total quantity. This has been already
observed before, so no change is required. Moreover, in a typical diet
problem  the constraints on nutrients take the form of inequalities:
a  :math:`\geq` inequality will be imposed 
for useful nutrients, while a :math:`\leq` one will be used for
harmful ones. Sometimes, both lower and upper bounds are imposed for
some nutrient.
The general diet model can be represented
as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_j \param{c}_j \var{x}_j & \\
   \sum_j \param{A}_{ij} \var{x}_j & \geq \param{\ell}_i & \forall \, i \\
   \sum_j \param{A}_{ij} \var{x}_j & \leq \param{u}_i & \forall \, i \\
   \var{x}_j & \geq 0
   \end{align*}
 
Denoting by :math:`\var{\lambda}_i` and
:math:`\mathvar{\mu}_i`, respectively, the dual variables associated to
the first and second group of constraints,
the dual of the diet model can be written as:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}

It is understood that when one of the two limitations is absent also
the corresponding dual variable does not enter the dual
formulation. The interpretation is similar to that of the blending
problem. We might notice that, assuming :math:`\param{\ell}_i < \param{u}_i`, in the optimal
solution either :math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_i = 0` or :math:`\mathvar{\mu}_i =0`
thanks to complementarity. Thus we may easily consider
:math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_i + \mathvar{\mu}_i` as the selling price of
nutrient :math:`i`. This price will be non negative for positive nutrients
(those associated with a minimum requirement), while for harmful
nutrients the selling price will be non positive: in order to "sell"
those nutrients we should give them for free or even as a discount on
the total synthetic diet cost.   The constraints in the dual thus just
represent the usual competitiveness constraints of the seller of pure
nutrients who would like to convince the diet buyer to choose pure
nutrients in place of real foods. In the objective function, depending
on the primal constraint, we will have either a price
:math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_i \param{\ell}_i` corresponding to selling :math:`\param{\ell}_i` units
of useful nutrients or a price :math:`\mathvar{\mu}_i \param{u}_i` associated to the
discount associated to the  inclusion of :math:`\param{u}_i` units of harmful
nutrients, or 0, for those nutrients whose contents, in the optimal
diet, is neither at the lower not at the upper bound.

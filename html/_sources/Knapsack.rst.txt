*************************************************
Knapsack, Bin Packing and Plant Location problems
*************************************************


============
Introduction
============

One of the "simplest" integer linear optimization  models
is the so-called :index:`knapsack` problem. Assume we are  given a
set of :math:`n`
"objects" and that to each of these both a "value"  and a
"weight" are associated. Assume also that a finite capacity, a non
negative real number, is given.
The problem then becomes to select a 
subset of objects whose total weight does not exceed capacity. Among
these sets of objects, it is required to find one with the highest possible total
value.

Denoting by :math:`\mathpar{v}_{j}` the value of the :math:`j`\ -th
object, with :math:`\mathpar{w}_{j}` its weight and
with :math:`\mathpar{b}` the capacity,
introducing a binary variable
associated with each object,  the following model is obtained:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
	     
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \mathpar{v}_{j} \mathvar{\delta}_{j} & \\
   \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \mathpar{w}_{j} \mathvar{\delta}_{j} & \leq \mathpar{b} \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_{j} & \in \{0,1 \} & j \in 1,n
   \end{align*}
 
This model is very basic, but  applications of
some practical interest exist, although the main interest in this
model consists  in the fact that 
its  constraints are often found in other, more complex, models.

To describe possible applications, we start from 
the name of the model. The idea is that a knapsack is available, which
can carry at most a certain capacity (which might be weight, volume,
number of standard pallets, ...). A set of objects is available, the
choice of each of which consumes part of the available capacity. The
problem consists then in filling the knapsack with the most valuable
collection of objects. It must be said that this application is just
used for teaching purposes, and nobody would ever prepare a knapsack this way.
However, if we slightly change the context, some direct application
comes to mind. As an example, the knapsack might be a truck, or a
container; the objects might be parcels to be delivered. The value is
a measure of the priority or of the urgency of delivery. 

In other contexts, objects might be projects to be chosen. A company
might have a number of possible projects to perform, each of which
requires some budget in order to be completed. The budget is the
weight associated to each project and the capacity is the overall
budget available. The value of each project is the revenue associated
to project delivery.  Slightly changing the application, instead of a
monetary budget, we might have an overall time budget, and different
projects will have different time consumption and different gains
associated. 
A similar application arises in advertising: there are a number of
available slots for placing a TV advertisement. Each slot is sold from
the TV company, and the price is the "weight" of the object. The available
budget for this marketing operation is the capacity. The value
associated to each slot might be the expected audience, i.e., the
expected number of people who will see the advertisement.

This model is called :index:`binary knapsack`, as, for any object, the
decision to be taken is whether to choose or not each single
object. It would be trivial to
extend the model to cover the case in which some objects are available
in multiple copies, changing  binary variables into
non negative integer ones, with an upper bound equal to the number of 
available objects.

The basic knapsack  model is only apparently a
simple one, with a single constraint (apart from binary constraints).
In integer optimization, the number of constraints or
variables is not, in general,  an indicator of the complexity of a
problem.
Indeed, often, the reverse is true, with more efficient models
characterized by formulations with a huge number of constraints.

There exist many heuristics for the approximate solution of
knapsack problems; moreover, the simple structure 
of the constraints makes the solution of the linear relaxation 
particularly simple. In fact, the optimal solution of the
linear relaxation is obtained by first sorting the objects in  non-increasing order
with respect to the ratio between  value and weight. Scanning this
list, if an object fits the knapsack, it is chosen (its binary
variable is set to 1). As soon as a  first object is found which
cannot be included in the solution, the corresponding variable is set
to the fraction of the object
necessary to "saturate" the capacity constraint.


.. math::
   :nowrap:
	 
   \begin{align*}
   \bar{\jmath} &:= \arg \max \{i: \sum_{j=1}^{i} \mathpar{w}_{i} \leq b
   \} \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_j & = 1 & \forall \, j \leq \bar{\jmath} \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_{\bar{\jmath}+1} & = \frac{b -
   \sum_{i=1}^{\bar{\jmath}} \mathpar{w}_j}{\mathpar{w}_{\bar{\jmath}+1}}  \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_j & = 0 & \textrm{ otherwise}
   \end{align*}
   

A simple implementation of the basic model is given:
   
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/Knapsack.mod
   :caption: Knapsack.mod
   :language: ampl

while the following is a tiny numerical example:
 
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/Knapsack.dat
   :caption: Knapsack.dat
   :language: ampl

Solving the model, given its very small size, is indeed very easy. A
solver like, e.g., CBC, in a fraction of a second, and 24 Branch and
Bound iterations, returns the optimal solution consisting in choosing
objects A, B, C, D, H, I, N, O, with total weight 730 ( full capacity)
and total profit 1418. The relaxed solution has objects
A, C, G, H, I, N, O fully in the knapsack, while object M is chosen at
54.78% level. The optimal value of the relaxed problem is 1423.07,
from which we see that the gap between the optimal and the relaxed
solution is relatively small (0.36%).

We can already see from this tiny example that the integer solution is not
a rounding of the solution of the linear relaxation.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced modeling: cover inequalities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Although the purpose of this part is to introduce modeling
   techniques,
   some algorithmic aspects need to be addressed too, as, for difficult
   integer optimization problems, the possibility of finding an optimal  solution
   is connected with the goodness of the formulation, something which  goes beyond
   the purely formal correctness. That is, there might be  different 
   correct formulations of the same problem, all of which are exact from the point of view
   of modeling, but  different from the point
   of view of their closedness to the ideal representation. Within
   integer optimization, the boundary between models and algorithms is quite
   vague. 

   Many of the most recent
   integer linear optimization approaches require a reformulation of the
   problem using additional constraints whose purpose is,
   mainly, to improve the value of the linear relaxation,
   decreasing the gap between the optimal solution and the relaxed one.
   Inserting additional constraints without eliminating any
   feasible solution leads to a smaller polyhedron in the relaxation and,
   as a consequence, to a possible improvement in the value of the relaxed problem.
   There exist no general and efficient technique to define 
   these additional constraints, and specific classes need to be devised
   for each specific class of problems.
   Finding classes of these inequalities is, thus, in a certain sense a
   modeling problem, albeit
   different from those encountered so far.
   
   For the binary backpack problem, a few simple arguments
   allow us to deduce some valid constraints for the problem which are in
   general not valid for the  linear relaxation. The 
   family of *cover inequalities* can be deduced
   from the trivial observation that if :math:`k` items
   have a total weight greater than the capacity,
   then no more than :math:`k-1` of them can belong to a feasible solution.
   In formulae, if :math:`S` is a subset of objects
   such that

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \[
      \sum_{j \in S} \mathpar{w}_{j}> \mathpar{b}
      \]

   then the following inequality is valid

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \[
      \sum_{j \in S} \mathvar{\delta}_{j} \leq |S| -1
      \]
   
   where :math:`| S |` denotes the cardinality of the set :math:`S`.
 
   An inequality like this one is not necessarily satisfied in the points of
   linear relaxation polyhedron. 
   Adding all possible cover inequalities to the formulation
   is not a feasible approach, in general, as their number can be huge; moreover,
   many of these inequalities are redundant, as they are dominated by
   others of the same family. An improvement 
   on this family of inequalities  corresponds to 
   considering only *minimal* sets,  with respect to the property of
   being a cover (that is, to contain objects that exceed the
   capacity of the container).

   Let us consider a simpler numerical example, to outline the basic idea
   of adding cover inequalities. Consider a knapsack problem with the
   following objects:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \begin{array}{ccccccc|c}
      A & B & C & D & E & F & G & b \\
      11 & 6 & 6 & 5 & 5 & 4 & 1 & 19
      \end{array}
      \end{align*}

   We do not write the objective function as our purpose here is just to
   show how to improve the formulation, i.e., how to add valid
   inequalities. In a real situation, however, a procedure, called
   *separation* should be defined which, given the solution of a
   relaxation of the problem, finds at least one cut inequality, i.e., a
   valid inequalities which makes the current solution of the relaxed
   problem infeasible. Adding such a cut would lead to an improvement in
   the relaxation and to finding a different solution of the relaxed
   problem.

   Consider objects A, B, C: their total weight is 23, thus they can be
   used to form a cover inequality:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B + \mathvar{\delta}_C & \leq 2 
      \end{align*}

   If we consider, e.g., C, D, E, F, G, their total weight is 21, so we
   might define a cover inequality form these objects, with right hand
   side 4 (no more than 4 of these 5 can be in any knapsack). However,
   the objects still form a cover if we cancel object G, the lightest
   one. So the inequality

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_C + \mathvar{\delta}_D + \mathvar{\delta}_E +
      \mathvar{\delta}_F & \leq 3  
      \end{align*}

   is a valid cover inequality and it dominates the one obtained
   including object G.

   Another observation is worth at this point: if at most 3 out of the
   set of objects :math:`C,D,E,F` can be inserted in a feasible
   knapsack, it is clear that, including in the set also objects
   :math:`A,B`, whose weight is even larger, will not lead to the
   possibility of inserting more than 3 objects. It is thus true that the
   following inequality

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_A + \mathvar{\delta}_B + \mathvar{\delta}_C +
      \mathvar{\delta}_D + \mathvar{\delta}_E + 
      \mathvar{\delta}_F & \leq 3  
      \end{align*}

   is also valid. Moreover, this inequality is stronger that the cover inequality
   associated to the whole set :math:`A,B,C,D,E,F`, since this
   would need a right hand side
   equal to 5. This kind of inequality is called an :index:`extension
   of the cover inequality`. In general, given a cover associated to a subset of
   objects :math:`S`, and extended cover inequality is given by

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{j \in S} \mathvar{\delta}_j + \sum_{j \not\in S : \mathpar{w}_j \geq
      \mathpar{w}_k \forall\,k \in S}  \mathvar{\delta}_j & \leq |S| -1
      \end{align*}

   It can be recalled here that these inequalities, i.e.,
   non-dominated cover inequalities and extended cover inequalities,
   are already a potentially large family of valid inequalities;
   however, although large, this set of inequalities is not sufficient
   to fully describe the ideal polyhedron for the binary knapsack
   problem. Other inequalities, in particular those known as
   :index:`lifted inequalities` can be defined and added to the 
   set. We refer the interested reader to the vast literature on this
   subject, starting, e.g., by :cite:`NemhauserWolsey`.
   In any case, for moderate to large size problem instances,
   generating and adding all these inequalities to the formulation is
   usually out of question. What can be done is to solve a relaxation
   of the problem, to design a procedure
   to separate the solution of the relaxation, if not feasible; and
   then to add this inequality to the formulation, solve again and
   repeat the loop. Recall however that separation, i.e., finding a
   violated inequality within the family of cover and lifted
   inequalities, is as hard as solving the problem from scratch and,
   in general, heuristic separation methods are used. These methods
   can often generate a valid inequality which cuts off the current
   solution, but, sometimes, cannot find one even if it exists.

   The emphasis we have given to this advanced topic here is connected
   to the fact that the importance of knapsack valid inequalities goes
   far beyond the problem itself. In fact any inequality with
   binary constraints can be seen as a knapsack inequality,
   possibly after a few variable substitutions. 
   Consider, as an example the generic inequality

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      3 \mathvar{\delta}_1 - 5 \mathvar{\delta}_2 +2
      \mathvar{\delta}_3 -2\mathvar{\delta}_4 & \leq 1
      \end{align*}

   If we replace the variables with a  negative coefficient with their 
   complement to 1, we obtain

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      3 \mathvar{\delta}_1 - 5 (1- \mathvar{\bar{\delta}}_ 2) +2
      \mathvar{\delta}_3 -2 (1- \mathvar{\bar{\delta}}_ 4) & \leq 1
      \end{align*}
      
   which simplifies to

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      3 \mathvar{\delta}_1 + 5 \mathvar{\bar{\delta}}_ 2 +2
      \mathvar{\delta}_3 +2 \mathvar{\bar{\delta}}_ 4 & \leq 8
      \end{align*}
      
   and this is exactly  a binary knapsack constraint. We can, thus, add
   cover inequalities and their generalizations in order to strengthen the
   formulation. A  similar technique can be applied in the case
   of  :math:`\geq` constraints; thus  any inequality constraint
   in binary variables is equivalent to a knapsack inequality
   and, therefore, can be strengthened through the techniques seen
   in this paragraph. This is indeed done by many of the advanced
   exact mixed integer optimization solvers available.

=================================
Multiple knapsacks, Cutting Stock
=================================
 
The knapsack model can be easily generalized to the case of multiple knapsacks
(or multiple containers). The problem may still be that of choosing
the maximum  "value" of the selected objects, with constraints
imposing not to exceed the  capacity of each of the available containers.
The "natural" formulation  of the problem is quite immediate, after the
presentation of the binary knapsack problem. However an important
difference characterizes these models. Now the decision to be taken is
not just whether an object is to be chosen or not:  if an object
is chosen, we need to decide also to which container will the object
be allocated. We can obtain this result by using two indices for each
binary variable, one associated to each object,
the other one  associated to each container. Let 
:math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}` be a binary variable with value 1 if and only
if the object :math:`j`  is placed in
container :math:`i`. With this choice of variables, the  formulation
closely follows that 
of the standard knapsack;  the main variants are the presence of a  
capacity constraint for each container  and a constraint which forbids
the same object to be included into more than one container.

Let us denote by
:math:`\mathpar{n}`, as before, the number of objects and by :math:`\mathpar{C}` the
number of containers, each of which characterized by a finite capacity
:math:`\mathpar{Cap}_i`.  
A model for this problem might be written as follows: 

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \max_{\mathvar{\delta}}  \sum_{j=1}^n  \sum_{i=1}^C  \mathpar{v}_j
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \\
   \sum_{i=1}^C \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq 1 & \forall\,j=1,\ldots,n \\
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_j \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq \mathpar{Cap}_i &
   \forall\,i=1,\ldots,C \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \in \{0,1\}  & \forall\,i,j
   \end{align*}
   
The first group of inequalities state that each object can be placed
*at most* once in a single container. The second group is composed of
knapsack constraints, one for each container, each of which
characterized by a maximum capacity.
It is worth observing that these knapsack inequalities might also be
generalized to cope with multiple, different, capacity measures for each
container. Consider, as an example, loading a group of trucks, taking
into account both the weight as well as the volume required and
available. Then, for each truck, two knapsack inequalities can be
imposed, one for the total weight, and another one for the total
volume. Of course volume computation is especially hard, if this
depends on how the parcels are loaded in the three-dimensional
available space. However, in many cases, the actual loading pattern
might be disregarded, and a total volume occupancy can be simply
computed. This is the case, e.g., for goods delivered in pallets: the
volume occupied by a pallet depends only on the base surface, as all
of the vertical space above the pallet is unavailable for further loading. It
remains the problem of deciding a two-dimensional arrangement, but
pallet measures are standard and efficient loading patterns can be decided a
priori.

A classical application of this model, apart from the natural one in
transport logistics, is  related to one dimensional :index:`cutting
stock problems`:
given a set of one-dimensional objects (for example cables)
and a set of purchase orders, defined as lengths of cable to be cut for
a customer, a problem might be that of deciding which order to satisfy
and from which of the available cables to cut it, in order to maximize
a total value, which, in some cases, is a measure of the priority of
each order.

In the following we report an example of implementation of a tiny
example:
   
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/cutstock.mod
   :caption: cutstock.mod
   :language: ampl

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/cutstock.dat
   :caption: cutstock.dat
   :language: ampl

The example is referred to a cutting stock elementary case.
In the example, we assume to  have three cables, whose lengths are 35, 30, 28,
respectively, and we wish to cut them in order to satisfy orders,
given in the data file, according to their required quantity and to
their value (priority).
When solved with a good quality branch and bound method, we obtain the optimal
solution  consisting in allocating orders A and D to cable 1 (using
its full capacity), orders E, F, I to cable 2 (again, used at full
capacity) and orders C and G to cable 3, using 27 out of 28 units. Orders
B, H , J could not be satisfied.

=====================================
Bin packing -  container optimization
=====================================

An important variant of the multiple knapsack model
consists in the optimization of the total number or total cost
of the *containers* needed to host all of the objects. The model
becomes more complex in this case. In fact it becomes necessary to add
a  variable for each container, whose value is 1 if and only if the
container is used. We define a
binary variable :math:`\var{y}_i, i =1,C` and,
through suitable constraints, we  impose that this variable has
value 1 if and only if container :math:`i` contains  at least
an object.
There are several ways to formulate this constraint, some of which
related to the formulation of logical constraints as we have seen in
chapter :ref:`Using binary variables in logical constraints`. In fact the
link between object allocation and container usage
can be formulated as:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   \exists \, j: \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 \implies \var{y}_i = 1
   \]

or, equivalently,

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   \var{y}_i = 0 \implies  \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 0 \quad \forall \, j
   \]

The opposite implication is not needed as, in general, to each
container a positive cost is associated, so that there is no incentive
to have the binary variable associated to a container have value 1
when no object is placed in that container.

Let :math:`\mathpar{c}_i` denote the cost of using
container :math:`i`. If all costs are equal to one, the problem
becomes that of finding the minimum number of containers which are
sufficient to carry all of the required load. Otherwise the problem
consists in minimizing the cost of used containers.
The generic bin-packing problem can thus be formulated as

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \min_{\var{y}, \mathvar{\delta}}  \sum_{i=1}^C \mathpar{c}_i
   \var{y}_i \\
   \sum_{i=1}^C \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & = 1 & \forall\,j=1,\ldots,n \\
   \exists \, j: \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_i = 1 &
   \forall\,i=1,C \\
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_j
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq \mathpar{Cap}_i & 
   \forall\,i=1,\ldots,C \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \in \{0,1\}  & \forall\,i,j \\
   \var{y}_i & \in \{0,1\} & \forall\, i
   \end{align*}
  
 
A possible formulation of the implication is the following:
the logical statement :math:`\mathvar{\delta} _ {ij} = 0 \, \forall \, j` can be
written as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \[
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq 0 \quad
   \forall\,i =1,C
   \]
   
so that the implication becomes

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{y}_i = 0 & \implies \sum_{j =1}^n
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq 0
   \end{align*}
 
Recalling  modeling techniques with logical variables,
a redundant constraint needs to be imposed for the case in which the implicant
is false. Here if :math:`\var{y}_i = 1`
an upper bound needs to be chosen for the right hand side. A simple
upper bound is given by the cardinality of the set of objects: in
fact, if a container is used, the total number of objects which might
be assigned to it is bounded by the total number of available objects.

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq \mathpar{M}_i && \forall \,
   i =1,C
   \end{align*}
   
where :math:`\mathpar{M}_i` can be chosen equal to
:math:`n`. As an alternative, this constant might be
chosen equal to an upper bound on the number of objects which can be
assigned to the container taking into account also their weight. If objects
are sorted in non decreasing order with respect to the weight, then we
might choose

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   M_i &= \max \{k : \sum_{j=1}^k \mathpar{w}_j \leq \mathpar{Cap}_i\}
   \end{align*}

Given a correct upper bound, the logical constraint can be transformed
into a linear one:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   :label: bpform1
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &\leq \mathpar{M}_i
   \var{y}_i & \forall \, i = 1,C
   \end{align*}
 
There exist other correct  formulations for the same constraint.
The logical implication might also be
seen as equivalent to 

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{y}_i = 0 & \implies \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 0 &  \forall \, i
   = 1, C, j = 1, n
   \end{align*}
 
This corresponds to the linear model

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   :label: bpform2
	   
   \begin{align*}
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &\leq \var{y}_i & \forall \, i =1,C, j=1,n
   \end{align*}
 
Finally another  modeling possibility consists in considering the
knapsack inequality and using the binary variable associated to the
container to switch the actual capacity between zero and the real
capacity, depending on the value of the binary variable.

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   :label: bpform3
      
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_{j} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
   &\leq \mathpar{Cap}_{i} \var{y}_i & \forall \, i = 1,C
   \end{align*}

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Comparison between the formulations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
   The first formulation  given above,
   :math:`\sum_{j=1}^n \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq \mathpar{M}_i \var{y}_i`, is weaker than
   the second one, :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq \var{y}_i`,
   at least when the upper bound chosen for
   the logical implication is the total number of objects. In fact, to
   see this, observe that if we sum, with respect to the objects,
   all of the inequalities of
   the second formulation  we obtain the first one:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq \var{y}_i  & \implies \\
      \sum_{j=1}^n \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &\leq \sum_{j
      =1}^n  \var{y}_i  \\ 
      & = n \var{y}_i
      \end{align*}
   
   This means that the polyhedron obtained by relaxing the binary
   constraint on all variables in the second formulation
   is contained in the polyhedron obtained from
   the first one.  Thus the second formulation is at least as
   strong as the first one. In order to check whether it is strictly
   stronger, and, thus, preferable from the point of view of the
   quality of the relaxation, we need to exclude that the two
   polyhedra are identical. But this is true as we can always find a
   solution in the first  polyhedron which does not belong to the
   second one, provided that the number of objects is
   greater than one. As an example, let


   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} &= 0 & \forall \, j \ne 1 \\
      \mathvar{\delta}_{i1} &= 1 \\
      \var{y}_i & =  1 / n
      \end{align*}

      
   This is an example of a solution which satisfies the constraints of
   the first formulation, but violates some of the constraints in the
   second one. Observe that, in order to show an example like this one,
   we had to search among non binary solutions. In fact, both
   formulations are correct, which means that they describe exactly
   the same set of binary feasible solutions. If a difference exists
   between the two formulation, this needs to be searched in the
   relaxed, non binary, set of solutions.

   For what concerns the third 
   formulation, :math:`\sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_{j} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \leq \mathpar{Cap}_{i} \var{y}_i`, this is 
   not directly comparable with the others: depending on  the values
   of the parameters, it could be
   stronger, weaker, or even neither stronger nor weaker than the
   other ones. This means that the relaxation of this formulation
   might neither be contained nor containing any of the other two. 
   In this case, a possibility might be to use both formulations, in
   order to strengthen the resulting model.
 
   Here we have shown that the second formulation is stronger than the
   first one. However, it contains many more constraints and thus,
   for large problems,
   the overhead due to the need to solve large linear optimization problems
   might mitigate the advantages of a stronger formulation.
   A possibility, for large problems,  could be
   that of using the strongest formulation in an implicit, dynamic, way.
   As we have already seen, the idea is to avoid the explicit
   insertion of  all of the constraints in the initial formulation, but
   adding some of them, as needed and when needed.
   We might  solve the problem without any constraint
   linking logical variables associate to objects with those
   associated to containers. Then we might insert
   only those constraints of the  type :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{ij}
   \leq \var{y}_i` that are violated in the
   current solution. Solving the problem  obtained in this way
   either  a feasible solution is obtained, in which case it will be
   also  optimal for the original problem. Otherwise,  there must
   exist some violated constraint among those 
   not yet included in the formulation. These constraints are added to the
   formulation and the whole process is iterated.

   In the general formulation of bin packing problems, a requirement prescribes
   to choose exactly one copy of each item to be placed in one of the
   containers (and only one). If we change the constraint  allowing  an
   integer number of copies, :math:`\mathpar{N}_j` of each
   object to be chosen, the problem remains quite similar in formulation, except that
   the constraints now becomes

      \begin{align*}
      \min_{\var{y}, \mathvar{\delta}}  \sum_{i=1}^C \mathpar{c}_i
      \var{y}_i \\
      \sum_{i=1}^C \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & = \mathpar{N}_j & \forall\,j=1,\ldots,n \\
      \exists \, j: \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_i = 1 &
      \forall\,i=1,C \\
      \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_j
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq \mathpar{Cap}_i & 
      \forall\,i=1,\ldots,C \\
      \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \in \{0,1\}  & \forall\,i,j \\
      \var{y}_i & \in \{0,1\} & \forall\, i
      \end{align*}
  
   This model generalizes the
   cutting stock one to the case in which all orders have to
   be satisfied.

   An application of bin-packing to a context different from that of
   loading containers frequently found in logistics, or optimally cutting
   parts from a minimum number of cables, is in the context of production
   scheduling.
   Here the containers are production machines, or plants, with their
   maximum capacity (e.g., hours in a day); objects are jobs, with a
   duration. If each machine has a cost, the problem becomes that of
   scheduling all of the jobs so that the minimum (number or cost) of
   necessary machines is found. A related problem is that of minimizing
   the :index:`makespan`, i.e. the completion time of the last finishing
   job. This problem can be easily modeled introducing an additional
   variable, the makespan, which is greater or equal to the total sum of
   used capacity in each machine (it is indeed an instance of :ref:`Minimax problems`).

==============
Plant location
==============

These problems arise in a quite different context, but share some
interesting modeling aspect with the models just presented. Assume
that a set of :math:`n` customers, with a known demand for a product
are to be served by a set of plants, or inventories, whose location
has to be chosen based on cost considerations. A set of :math:`C`
possible locations are known, and building a facility at location
:math:`i` has a cost :math:`\mathpar{c}_i`. The (expected) demand
of each customer is :math:`\mathpar{w}_j` and the maximum capacity of
each location is :math:`\mathpar{Cap}_i`. Every customer chooses one of
the available facilities in order to satisfy all of the
demand. Another relevant information is the cost of connecting a
customer with a location: a quantity :math:`\mathpar{TC}_{ij}` is
given which represents the cost of serving customer :math:`j` from
location :math:`i` - this might be thought of as a transportation
cost. The overall model thus becomes:


.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \min_{\var{y}, \mathvar{\delta}}  \sum_{i=1}^C \mathpar{c}_i
   \var{y}_i  + \sum_{i=1}^C \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{TC}_{ij} \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} \\
   \sum_{i=1}^C \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & = 1 & \forall\,j=1,\ldots,n \\
   \exists \, j: \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} = 1 & \implies \var{y}_i = 1 &
   \forall\,i=1,C \\
   \sum_{j=1}^n \mathpar{w}_j
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \leq \mathpar{Cap}_i & 
   \forall\,i=1,\ldots,C \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_{ij} & \in \{0,1\}  & \forall\,i,j \\
   \var{y}_i & \in \{0,1\} & \forall\, i
   \end{align*}
  
and the similarity with the bin-packing model is evident. Of course,
the logical implication should be modeled as a regular constraint, as
we have already seen.

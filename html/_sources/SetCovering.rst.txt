--------------------------------
Set covering, packing, partition
--------------------------------

Problems in this section are widely used and give rise, in some
application fields, to huge dimensional optimization problems. All
these problems can be formalized as the choice of subsets of a ground
set which satisfy some constraints.

The :index:`set covering` problem is formally defined  as follows: 
Consider a finite set :math:`\mathcal{S}` and a collection of 
subsets:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \mathcal{C}  & = \{C_1,C _2, \ldots, C_k\}
    \subseteq 2^{\mathcal{S}}
   \end{align*}

where with :math:`2^{\mathcal{S}}` we denote the :index:`power set` of
:math:`\mathcal{S}`, i.e. the set of all of its subsets.

A :index:`covering` of :math:`\mathcal{S}` with sets in the collection
:math:`\mathcal{C}` is defined as  a set of sets
:math:`C_{i_1}, \ldots, C_{i_h} \in \mathcal{C}` such that

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \cup_{j = 1}^{h} C_{i_j} = \mathcal{S}
   \end{align*}
 
A :index:`packing`  is defined as a collection of pairwise *disjoint*
sets:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   C_{\ell} \cap C_{k} & = \emptyset  & \forall\, \ell,k \in \{i_1,
   \ldots, i_h\}
   \end{align*}
 
A :index:`partitioning` is a collection of subsets which is,
simultaneously, both a covering and a packing. In other words, every
element in the ground set is contained in one and only one of the sets
of the chosen collection.

The formal definition perhaps does not allow to immediately appreciate
the importance of these models. Some  relevant applications will be
presented later in this paragraph. We now present a formulation of the
problem as an integer linear optimization model.

:model: Set Covering

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|
   
   *  :math:`\set{Requests}`: a set of requests which are to be covered;
   *  :math:`\set{Resources}`: a set of potentially available resources
   *  :math:`\set{Pairs} \subseteq \set{Requests} \times
      \set{Resources}`: a
      pair :math:`(i, j)` belongs to the set :math:`\set{Pairs}`,
      with :math:`i \in \set{Requests}`
      and :math:`j \in \set{Resources}`,  if and only if the
      activation of
      resource :math:`i` is sufficient to cover the request
      :math:`j`.
      It is possible to think of this set as a set of arcs that
      connect resources and requests.

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|

   * :math:`\param{Cost}_j` the cost of activating  resource
     :math:`j \in \set{Resources}`; 

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_{j}`: binary variable, with  value one
     if and only if  resource
     :math:`j \in \set{Resources}` is activated;

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * Covering constraint: every request must be covered by *at least*
     an active  resource:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{j \in \set{Resources}: (i, j) \in \set{Pairs}} \mathvar{\delta}_{j}& \geq 1
	& \forall \, i \in \set{Requests}
	\end{align*}

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   * Minimization of the total activation cost:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \[
      \min \sum_{j \in \set{Resources}} \param{Cost}_j \mathvar{\delta}_j
      \]
 
The model just seen corresponds to the formal definition of
set-covering. In fact, the set :math:`\mathcal{S}` in the abstract
definition corresponds
to the set :math:`\set{Requests}`; for what concerns the subsets,
these are implicitly defined through the set of :math:`\set{Pairs}`:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   C_j &= \left \{i \in \set{Requests}: (i, j) \in \set{Pairs} \right \}
   & \forall \, j \in \set{Resources}.
   \end{align*}

The following is a possible implementation of the model, almost a
verbatim copy of the above model:

As an example, consider the application of this model to emergency
planning.


   :application: :index:`Localization of emergency facilities`

   In planning for emergency situations, it often happens that we need
   to decide the location of critical facilities in such a way that
   the population which might be affected by an emergency will find
   the necessary equipment or the required support as close as
   possible. Examples concern the localization of fire stations to
   respond to large scale fires, the localization of parking places
   for ambulances, ready to serve nearby population, the choice of
   emergency inventories (for medicines, medical devices, protective
   devices, ...). In these cases we can assume that the population is
   represented as a discrete set of nodes (cities, provinces, blocks
   in  a city,...); the resources to be activated might be localized
   in another (possibly, in the same) set of nodes. Between any pair
   of population nodes and potential resource nodes, a closeness
   measure has been computed. As an example, given the location of
   each node, a shortest path model can be solved, for every 
   origin/destination pair, to determine the travel length between the
   nodes. This length might be a mileage, or an average travel time.
   After this pre-processing step, we might consider a threshold on the
   maximum distance (in space or travel time) between a request node
   (a population) and a resource node. As an example, we might decide
   that no more than 20' should be necessary to travel between a
   resource node and the request node.  Given this threshold, we can
   state that a resource node covers a request node if the distance
   between the two nodes is below this threshold.  Given this, we
   usually look for the smallest number of resources to activate so
   that all request nodes are within the  maximum travel time
   from the closest activated
   resource node. In the example below we refer to a set of
   municipalities in the Tuscany region, and we consider all of them
   to be both a requesting node as well as a candidate location for a
   resource. The following data file, partially displayed, was used to generate the
   instance, which is based on official statistics on travel times and
   distance:
   
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/Pistoia.dat

      :lines: 1-20
      :language: ampl

   In order to solve the problem we first need to define requests and
   resources and to connect them with arcs, if their distance is below
   the chosen threshold:

   The following picture graphically displays the solution obtained by
   running the model with threshold: 20':

A matrix formulation of the set-covering problem is easily
obtained. In fact let :math:`A` denote the :index:`adjacency matrix`
of the requests/resources pairs, i.e. a binary matrix 
whose generic element :math:`a_{ij}` is 1 if and only if resource
:math:`j` covers the request of node :math:`i`.

Consider an instance of the set covering problem  represented in the following
figure:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \foreach \i/\x/\y in
   {1/1/5,2/3/5,3/5/5,4/1/3,5/3/3,6/5/3,7/1/1,8/3/1,9/5/1}
   \node[white,diamond,fill=cyan] (\i) at (\x,\y) {\i};
   \foreach \i/\x/\y in
   {A/2/6,B/2/4,C/4/4,D/2/2,E/4/2}
   \node[circle,fill=yellow] (\i) at (\x,\y) {\i};
   \foreach \f/\t  in
   {A/1,A/2,A/3,B/1,B/2,B/4,B/5,B/8,C/2,C/3,C/5,C/6,D/1,D/4,D/5,D/7,D/8,
   E/5,E/6,E/8,E/9}
   \draw[->] (\f) -- (\t);
   \end{tikzpicture}
   
In this figure, yellow circle nodes are potential resources,  while
light blue diamond nodes are requests and arcs connect feasible pairs.
The adjacency matrix of this instance is

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   A = \begin{array} {||r|ccccc||}
   \hline
     & A & B & C & D & E \\ \hline
   1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   3 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   4 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   5 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
   6 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
   7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   8 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
   9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}

Reading this matrix by rows, we can immediately see, for example,
that node 1 can be covered by resources A. B, D, while node 2 can be
covered by A, B, C.
Defining a  vector of variables :math:`\mathvar{\delta}`, the
problem can be formalized as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min c^T \mathvar{\delta}  & \\
   A \mathvar{\delta} & \geq  1 \\
   \mathvar{\delta} & \in  \{0,1\}^n
   \end{align*}
   
Set-covering problems, when analyzed as is usual in complexity theory,
in the worst case, have an exponential computational complexity. No
efficient algorithm is known to solve these problems efficiently.
However it can be shown that the
optimal (binary) solution is always a basic solution of the
linear relaxation of the problem, i.e., a vertex of the linear
relaxation of the problem. So it can happen, and indeed,
in practice, it happens quite frequently, that the
linear relaxation already generates the optimal binary solution or that,
at most, a few iterations of the Branch and Bound method are
sufficient. Thus, although theoretically very difficult, these
problems, quite often, are easily solved in practice.

The bottleneck, in many case, is their  huge size, which makes even
the solution of the  linear relaxation computationally hard.
Frequently, set covering examples encountered in practical
applications have millions of variables.

   :application: :index:`Shift planning`

   One of the fields in which the
   set covering model finds its widest use is that of
   shift planning (for hospital staff, flights,
   trains, etc.). In this case the needs to be covered are given
   by the number of nurses, pilots, locomotives respectively,
   that must be present in a given period of time on a date, at a 
   location or on a given route. The resources available are 
   given by possible shifts.
   Any shift will cover some of the available needs.
   The greatest complexity of these models consists in the
   fact that often the number of different allowed shifts is huge. These are
   all possible  work/no work combinations which satisfy
   specific regulations (such as laws, 
   union contracts, local preferences,...).
   In planning  air personnel shifts, it is normal
   to have covering  problems with millions of variables.
   In the following  example, we
   consider a generalization of the set-covering model, in 
   which, for each requirement, a minimum request  of employees
   is given; this request might be more than one, differently from
   standard covering
   problems. Moreover for each resource type which, in this case,
   represents a possible shift type, an integer number of resources
   might be chosen, not necessarily binary as in the standard set
   covering problem.

   The code below implements these small variations:
   
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/shifts.mod
      :caption: shifts.mod
      :language: ampl

   It can be immediately seen that this model is pretty similar to the
   set covering one. We decided to describe the feasible pairs (shifts
   - covered time slots) through the adjacency matrix instead of the
   usual list of pairs, for compactness reasons only.

   The following file describes a realistic instance, inspired by a
   small healthcare facility, operating 7/24, with different
   requirements during different days and different parts of the
   day. Each day is divided into 4 time slots: 08-12, 12-16, 16-20,
   20-08. A minimum request is given for each of these time slots. We
   assume here that feasible shifts have been generated according to
   the following rule:
   
   #. each week has two days off (V)
   #. each day only one shift type is possible among: 08-16, 12-20, 20-08
   #. the day after a night shift is a rest period and no other shift can
      be assigned
   #. no more than 2 nights per week are allowed
   #. shifts are to be considered as cyclical, so that if a night is
      allocated to Sunday, Monday should be a rest day.

   Applying in an exhaustive way these rules, 1316 possible shifts are
   obtained. For what concerns the cost, we considered each activate
   shift with only day shifts to cost 1, each weekly shift with one
   night to cost 2 and a week with two night shift to cost 5. 
   The following is a tiny excerpt from the data file representing this
   instance:
    
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/shifts.dat
      :caption: shifts.dat
      :lines: 1-20
      :language: ampl

   ...
   
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/shifts.dat
      :lines: 1323-1338
      :language: ampl

   It is seen that, for example, the first shift type, VVAAAAA,
   consists in having Monday and Tuesday as a vacation, and work the
   rest of the week in AM shifts, which means 08-16. The row in the
   adjacency matrix, thus, has a 1 corresponding to We0812, We1216,
   Th0812, Th1216, and so on.

   An optimal solution found is reported here:

   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/shifts.out
      :caption: shifts.out
      :language: ampl

   This problem is of moderately large size, with 1316 integer
   variables; however, a good solver could find the provably optimal
   solution in a fraction of a second, requiring 103 simplex
   iterations and exploring only one node in the branch and bound
   tree, confirming what has been previously stated: set covering
   problems are, quite often, easy to solve to optimality.

   From the output file it can be seen that in some time slots the
   active personnel is quite larger than that required. This is due,
   in particular, to the fact the two day shifts both cover the time
   period 12-16, which turns out in extra workers in these periods.

Another very relevant application of set covering models is in
solving difficult combinatorial problems by choosing suitable
components in the solution. Consider the problem of a delivery service
which needs to serve a set of customers with some trucks. If we are
allowed to list all possible subsets of customers served by a single
feasible route, than a set covering approach will choose which subset
of routes is the most convenient one and covers all of the deliveries.

   :application: :index:`Set Covering approach to Vehicle routing`

   :index:`Vehicle routing` is a very difficult combinatorial optimization
   problem; a short introduction to the problem will be presented in
   Chapter :ref:`Vehicle Routing`.
   A special case, with a single available vehicle,
   will be analyzed in Chapter :ref:`Sequencing problems: the
   Traveling Salesperson Problem`.  In the
   example here, assume routes have to be planned in order to cover at
   most three cities in the region we already used (file
   :math:`\texttt{Pistoia.dat}`). Routes might consists of single visits from the start
   node, which we assume to be the city of Pistoia; or they might be
   composed of two visits and, in this case, the order of visit is
   irrelevant, as we assume costs are symmetric. Or a route might
   consist of three cities to be visited. In this case, the order is
   relevant and, given three cities :math:`i,j,k`, the optimal route
   covering them has a cost which can be computes as the minimum of:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      c_{si}+c_{ij}+ c_{jk}+ c_{ks} \\
      c_{si}+c_{ik}+ c_{kj}+ c_{js} \\
      c_{sj}+c_{ji}+ c_{ik}+ c_{ks} 
      \end{align*}

   We, again, slightly revise the basic model to account for some
   peculiarities of this case (e.g., the Start node should not be
   covered, as it is to be considered as a depot):
  
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/VrpCovering.mod
      :caption: VrpCovering.mod
      :language: ampl
   
   Using data from file Pistoia.dat, we can run the set covering model
   by executing the following script:
  
   .. literalinclude:: AMPL/VrpCovering.run
      :caption: VrpCovering.run
      :language: ampl

   In the code, each route cost, corresponding to the total travel
   time from the start node, to the delivery nodes and back, is
   augmented with a constant (100 in the example) to promote the usage
   of a smaller number of trucks. It is a sort of fixed charge for
   using the truck. Solving this model requires a non negligible time,
   mostly devoted to generating the set of all feasible routes, which
   turn out out be 8421. Then, the real optimization is concluded in a
   very limited amount of time and results in the following route choice:

   The optimal routes thus found cover all of the request and have a
   duration, in minutes of traveling, which is displayed in the
   figure.

   The example above is very important as it shows how a very difficult
   combinatorial optimization can sometimes be solved by a clever
   implementation of a set covering model. Vehicle routing problems are
   notoriously extremely hard to solve in practice;
   solving these models by exact linear optimization models is out of
   question except for tiny examples. The example above is an important
   exception: if                 single routes can be in some way
   enumerated, then what remains is to pack routes together to cover the
   demand.
   A possibility, which is exploited in some real world applications, is
   to have some heuristic procedure generate a huge amount of feasible
   routes and then to delegate to the set covering model the choice of
   the best possible subset.
   It is worth also considering the fact that the above approach might
   easily be extended to even more challenging problems. Consider, for
   example, the case when there are additional constraints: an
   example are :index:`time windows`: each delivery should occur within a specific
   time frame. In the approach above, we can simply eliminate from the
   list those sets of visit nodes which do not satisfy these
   constraints,
   although many more routes need to be generated as in this case
   symmetry does not hold anymore. 
   Of course the difficulty should also be apparent: already
   limiting the nodes to be visited in a route to a maximum of three, in
   a small example like the one in the example we obtained more than eight
   thousand possible routes. Extending the number of nodes in a route
   will cause this number to explode. This is however not a hopeless
   strategy: methods do exist in which this enormous set of routes is
   only implicitly enumerated, without the need to exhaustively list all
   of them; a procedure is designed to check whether the current solution
   in a sequential algorithm is indeed the best one or if one of the
   routes not yet considered might be profitably included; thus the set
   of routes among which we choose is dynamically expanded. This subject
   is however out of topic for this modeling book.

Here we have just seen the most common model, set covering. The other
models we mentioned in this chapter are also very relevant in
applications.  The :index:`set packing` problem

.. math::
   :nowrap:
	   
   \begin{align*}
   \max \sum_{j \in \set{R}} c_j \mathvar{\delta}_j & \\
   \sum_{j \in \set{R}: (i, j) \in \set{Pairs}} \mathvar{\delta}_{j}& \leq 1
   & \forall \, i \in \set{U} \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_j & \in \{0,1\} & \forall\, j \in \set{R}
   \end{align*}

is concerned with placing a set of facilities, with the highest
possible value, so that no user (set :math:`\set{U}`) is covered by
more than one of these. An example application might be the
localization of some facilities which creates some disturbance to the
population: as an example, locating base stations for radio
transmission, so that interference is kept at a minimum. We might
think to a set of points where the signals are measured and all these
points should not be reached by more than one signal. This is a
maximization problem, as the constraints try to avoid placing too many
resources, so that the objective should try to contrast
this and promote the maximum compatible set to be chosen. The
objective function coefficients might be, e.g., a measure of the
population reached by a good quality signal.

Finally, the :index:`set partitioning` problem is both a set covering as
well as a packing:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
	   
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_{j \in \set{R}} c_j \mathvar{\delta}_j & \\
   \sum_{j \in \set{R}: (i, j) \in \set{Pairs}} \mathvar{\delta}_{j}& = 1
   & \forall \, i \in \set{U} \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_j & \in \{0,1\} & \forall\, j \in \set{R}
   \end{align*}

As an example, the vehicle routing problem  described above as an
application of the set covering model, is, indeed, a set partitioning,
as we wish every parcel to be delivered by exactly one and only one
truck.

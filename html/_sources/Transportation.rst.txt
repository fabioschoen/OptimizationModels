========================
The transportation model
========================

The transportation problem is a classic
network flow problem, used frequently in 
planning  shipments from various sources 
(producers) to different recipients (wholesalers, shops,
distributors, warehouses, final customers).
Assume that between some source and some destination
an arc is present, which represents the possibility of shipping from
that source to the specific destination. Assume also that the cost of shipping a
certain commodity is proportional to the shipped quantity.
Then the problem arises of how to allocate available products
to the recipients so that the total transport cost
is minimized. The constraints typically represent the finite
production or shipping capacity of each source node and the demand to
be satisfied at each destination node. Sometimes there is also a limit
on the flow over specific arcs.
 
This problem is the simplest possible version of a very relevant
logistic problem. The most important simplification in this model
concerns the cost structure: here it is assumed that the
costs are proportional to the quantity of shipped goods. This is
reasonable only in certain contexts: for example, if the
transport consists in data shipment over a telecommunication
network, then, as a first approximation, it might be 
reasonable to imagine that the assumption is
valid, as doubling the  amount of transmitted data might correspond,
on average, to doubling the transmission time or the 
bandwidth used and, frequently, the cost that
the user is charged for the usage  of the
communication line increases proportionally to time or bandwidth. Similarly, when
shipping is made through external couriers (third parties) who charge in proportion
to the  traveled distance and the mass of the transported material. Or, in a different
context, it might be reasonable to apply this cost model to
decisions on the electricity supply: the cost
connected with the transport of energy might be assumed to be  proportional to
the distance traveled and the amount of carried energy.

A radically different situation happens if the optimal
plan  needs to take into account
the cost of trucks used in transportation: in many cases, usage of  a
truck implies different costs: the cost of transportation might be
considered as more or less  constant, or just weakly increasing (as
a consequence of the fact that the higher the transported mass the
higher will be the consumption of fuel); this proportionality will have a
break, a discontinuity, as soon as the
shipped quantity will exceed the truck transportation capacity: in
this case a new truck would need to be acquired, or rent, with a
sudden increase on costs.
In cases like this one the problem is no longer the
classical transportation problem, but it is known as
the :ref:`Vehicle Routing` problem.


Consider a *bipartite* graph :math:`G = \langle V, E \rangle`; recall that
a graph is called *bipartite* if its nodes  can be divided
into two disjoint subsets (a bi-partition) :math:`V_{1}, V_{2}` so that
each arc has the start node in the first set and the end node in the 
second one. That is, the bipartition of nodes must be such that:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   V_{1} \cup V_{2} & = V \\
   V_{1} \cap V_{2} & = \emptyset \\
   (i, j) \in E & \implies i \in V_{1}, j \in V_{2}
   \end{align*}

   
For the transportation problem, the two sets correspond to the 
source and destination nodes. The linear transportation model has the
following form:

     
.. role:: model
   :class: smallcaps
	   
:model: Transportation model

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{Orig}`:  origin nodes
   * :math:`\set{Dest}`:  destination nodes
   * :math:`\set{E} \subseteq \set{Orig} \times \set{Dest}`: set
     of  direct connections between origins and destinations

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|

   * :math:`\param{Pr}_i`: upper bound on the production capacity
     (or on the available quantity of finished products)
     of node :math:`i \in \set{Orig}`;
   * :math:`\param{Dem}_j`: demand of destination :math:`j \in
     \set{Dest}`;
     it represents the exact quantity
     of goods that recipient :math:`j` requires;
   * :math:`\param{Cost}_{ij}`: unit  transportation cost along arc :math:`(i, j)
     \in \set{E}`

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|

   * :math:`\var{f}_{ij}`: quantity of goods to be shipped along
     arc :math:`(i, j) \in \set{E}`

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   *  Demand satisfaction:

      .. math::
	 :nowrap:
	 
	 \begin{align*}
	 \sum_{i \in \set{Orig}: (i, j) \in \set{E}} \var{f}_{ij} =
	 \param{Dem}_j && \forall \, j \in \set{Dest}
	 \end{align*}

      It is assumed here that all the  demand needs to be satisfied,
      although it would be simple to modify
      the model to include  the possibility of partially unsatisfied demand;
      
   *  Maximum production constraint:

      .. math::
	 :nowrap:
	    
	 \begin{align*}
	 \sum_{j \in \set{Dest}: (i, j) \in \set{E}} \var{f}_{ij} \leq \param{Pr}_i
	 && \forall \, i \in \set{Orig}
	 \end{align*}
      
      (goods shipped from each producer cannot exceed the
      maximum production, or the availability)
      
   *  Non negativity:
      :math:`\var{f}_{ij} \geq 0` for every arc;

|
   :model:`Objective:` 
|

   * Minimization of the overall transport cost:

     .. math::
	:nowrap:
	   
	\begin{align*}
	\min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{Cost}_{ij} \var{f}_{ij}
	\end{align*}

 
Although it might not be immediately apparent, this
model falls within the class of minimum cost flow models.
In fact, the objective function  is the same as that of the minimum
cost flow  problem.
For what concerns balance constraints, those associated to the demand
are exactly flow balances (for nodes with no outgoing arc). However,
the constraints on production nodes are inequalities.
But if we add a slack to transform them into equivalent equations:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j \in \set{Dest}: (i, j) \in \set{E}} \var{f}_{ij}
   + \var{s}_{i} & = \param{Pr}_i
    & \forall \, i \in \set{Orig}
   \end{align*}
   
then it is possible to interpret this as a balance constraint,  with
the slack variable :math:`\var{s}_i` representing a flow that, at zero
cost, goes from node :math:`i`  to a virtual deposit
whose demand is equal to the difference between the
maximum total production and overall satisfied demand. Thanks to this
interpretation, the model inherits all properties of  the minimum
cost flow model, including the integrality of optimal solutions if
maximum productions and demands are integer. 
This property, which is very desirable in general, is particularly
important here as it implies that no parcel needs to be subdivided
into parts.

It is also possible 
to formulate the same problem introducing, as we
did in the mixed :ref:`Production and distribution`
example, a single source node
connected with all sources, with arcs whose maximum capacity
corresponds to the limit on the productive capacity of each node.
 
:application: :index:`Transport of electricity`
	      
   An energy company owns various plants,
   located in different areas of a region, and wants to determine
   a minimum cost shipping plan of the produced energy
   to the main cities of the region. Assume that the company
   owns three plants whose maximum production (in 
   megawatt/hour) is given by the following table:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \begin{array} {| lc |} \hline
      \textrm{Plant} & \textrm{Max production} \\\hline
      \textrm{P} 1 & 40 \\
      \textrm{P} 2 & 50 \\
      \textrm{P} 3 & 40 \\\hline
      \end{array}
      \end{align*}

   while the destination cities have the following demand

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \begin{array} {| lc |} \hline
      \textrm{City} & \textrm{Request} \\\hline
      \textrm{C} 1 & 45 \\
      \textrm{C} 2 & 20 \\
      \textrm{C} 3 & 30 \\
      \textrm{C} 4 & 30 \\\hline
      \end{array}
      \end{align*}
      
      
   Finally, the shipping cost of one 
   megawatt / hour from the plants to the destination  cities is reported in
   table:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \[
      \begin{array} {| lcccc |} \hline
      & \textrm{C} 1 & \textrm{C} 2 & \textrm{C} 3 & \textrm{C} 4 \\\hline
      \textrm{P} 1 & 8 & 6 & 10 & 9 \\
      \textrm{P} 2 & 9 & 12 & 13 & 7 \\
      \textrm{P} 3 & 14 & 9 & 16 & 5 \\\hline
      \end{array}
      \]
      
   This transportation problem can be graphically represented as
   follows:

   .. tikz::

      \begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=1.1,xscale=0.9]
      \newcommand{\tvar}[1]{{\color{red}{\small{\mathbf{#1}}}}}
      \newcommand{\tparam}[1]{{\color{blue}{#1}}}
      \foreach \x / \y / \name / \colnode in
      {-1/0/i/,2/0/j/,-1/3/s/}   
      \node[vertex,\colnode] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
      \foreach \x / \y / \name / \colnode in
      {1/1/P3/green!25,1/3/P2/green!25,1/5/P1/green!25,6/0/C4/cyan!25,6/2/C3/cyan!25,
      6/4/C2/cyan!25,6/6/C1/cyan!25}   
      \node[vertex,\colnode] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
      \foreach \source /  \dest / \cost / \capac in
      {i/j/$\tparam{c}_{ij}$/;$\tparam{Fmax}_{ij}$,s/P1/0/;40,s/P2/0/;50,s/P3/0/;40,P1/C1/8/,P1/C2/6/,P1/C3/10/,P1/C4/9/,
      P2/C1/9/,P2/C2/12/,P2/C3/13/,P2/C4/7/, P3/C1/14/,P3/C2/9/,P3/C3/16/,P3/C4/5/}
      \path[arc] (\source) -- node[font=\tiny,sloped,near end,above left]
      {\cost \capac} (\dest);
      \node[below right=1em] at (C1) { -45};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C2) { -20};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C3) { -30};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C4) { -30};
      \end{tikzpicture}

   In the above graph an infinite upper capacity limit has been
   omitted. Inequality constraints on the maximum production levels
   have been represented through the introduction of a dummy source
   node connected to each plant by means of an arc whose maximum
   allowed flow is the upper bound on the capacity.
      
   By solving the problem, an optimal solution can be obtained, with a
   total cost of 1005, with the following structure:


   .. tikz::

      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
      \foreach \x / \y / \name / \colnode in
      {1/1/P3/green!25,1/3/P2/green!25,1/5/P1/green!25,6/0/C4/cyan!25,6/2/C3/cyan!25,
      6/4/C2/cyan!25,6/6/C1/cyan!25}   
      \node[vertex,\colnode] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C1) { -45};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C2) { -20};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C3) { -30};
      \node[below right=1em] at (C4) { -30};
      \foreach \source / \dest /\flow in
      {P1/C2/15,P1/C3/25,P2/C1/45,P2/C3/5,P3/C2/5,P3/C4/30}
      \path[arc,blue] (\source) -- node[font=\tiny,sloped,above left,near end]
      {\flow} (\dest);
      \end{tikzpicture}

   where it can be seen that plant 3 does not use its full production
   capacity.

   
 
As we have seen, in the transportation model, each shipment 
takes place from producers to consumers: the graph of
the transportation network is indeed bi-partite. Some variants of the model are possible
which allow cumulative transport
to multiple destinations. In this case it could be
convenient to send a quantity from a single origin 
to satisfy the demand  of two or more destinations, allowing for the
delivery to one of them and then to the others. In this
extension there will be transportation arcs 
connecting multiple destinations. Similarly,
we might think of the case where goods are  loaded in a
plant and, before delivery to customers,  goods
produced in other plants are collected: there are therefore arcs
which connect origin nodes. The inclusion of these arcs turns the transportation problem into
a generic minimum cost flow one.
 
Another very important variant arises when considering 
temporal dynamics, a
transportation model in which planning includes several
days or different periods; decisions associated to two consecutive
time periods are connected through an inventory. The quantity produced in a
period :math:`t` which is not sent to any destination becomes an input, ready
for shipping, for period :math:`t + 1`.
In a similar way, it might be useful to model situations in which the
demand cannot be satisfied by current production or by the available
inventory. In this case the demand constraint becomes a "soft" one,
which can be violated, although at a cost. This can be represented in
a network by adding transportation arcs which run "backward" in time
from production nodes to destination ones: an arc from a producer at
time :math:`t+1` to a destination at time :math:`t` represents a
demand which can be satisfied with one period delay, if
needed. Usually these backward arcs have a higher unit cost to
represent penalties for demand which is satisfied after the correct period.

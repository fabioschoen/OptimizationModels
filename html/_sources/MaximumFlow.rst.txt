============
Maximum Flow
============
 
The  maximum flow problem concerns finding
a *feasible* flow in a network (i.e., a flow which satisfies upper and
lower bounds on all arcs as well as the required balances at nodes)  in
such a way as to maximize the total  
quantity of flow entering or circulating in the network. While in  the
formulation of the minimum cost path  problem a single unit of flow
was considered, here
the amount of the circulating flow is unknown and it is the objective
we would like to maximize.
As in the minimum cost path problem, also here it is assumed that the
balance at every node is zero, with the only exception of the source
and destination.

Before 
formulating the problem it is necessary to define 
the quantity of flow circulating in a network. Assume
there exist  a unique source and destination nodes, and that  the source
has only outgoing arcs, while the destination has only entering arcs.
The :index:`value` of the flow  circulating in such a  network is defined as the sum of
flows out from the source.

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \var{val} & = \sum_{j: (s,j) \in E} \var{f}_{sj}
   \end{align*}

It is easy to proof that flow conservation law
implies that this quantity is also equal to the total flow entering
the destination node


.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \var{val} & = \sum_{i: (i,t) \in E} \var{f}_{it}
   \end{align*}

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.6, auto,swap]
   \newcommand{\tvar}[1]{{\color{red}{\small{\mathbf{#1}}}}}
   \newcommand{\tparam}[1]{{\color{blue}{#1}}}
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0/1/s,1/2/A,1/0/B,2/1/t,0/-.5/i,2/-.5/j}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {$\name$};
   \foreach \source/\dest/\flow/\cap in
   {s/A/4/4,s/B/5/8,A/B/2/5,A/t/2/7,B/t/7/7,i/j/$\tvar{f}_{ij}$/$\tparam{Fmax}_{ij}$} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {\flow:\cap} (\dest); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

In the network above labels represent a feasible flow and the upper
bound (or capacity) on each arc. The total flow out from the source
node is 9 (4 units on :math:`(s,A)`, 5 on  :math:`(s,A)`). The
same quantity of flow can be measured at the destination node
:math:`t`, with  a total of 9 units entering.

 
Formally the problem can be represented as follows

.. role:: model
   :class: smallcaps
	   
:model: Maximum flow

|
   :model:`Sets:`
|

   * :math:`\set{V}`: nodes of the graph
   * :math:`\set{E} \subseteq \set{V} \times \set{V}`: arcs

|
   :model:`Parameters:`
|

   * :math:`s \in V`: source node
   * :math:`t \in V`: destination node
   * :math:`\param{Fmin}_{ij}`: lower  capacity of
     arc :math:`(i, j) \in E` - frequently this is equal to 0
   * :math:`\param{Fmax}_{ij}`: maximum capacity of arc :math:`(i, j) \in E`

|
   :model:`Variables:`
|
     
   * :math:`\var{f}_{ij}`: flow on arc :math:`(i, j)`
   * :math:`\var{val}`: value of the flow

|
   :model:`Constraints:`
|

   * Flow conservation:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      \sum_{(v, j) \in E} \var{f}_{vj} - \sum_{(i, v) \in E}
      \var{f}_{iv} &=
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{rl}
      \var{val} & \text{ if } v = s \cr
      -\var{val} & \text{ if } v = t \cr
      0 & \text{ otherwise}
      \end{array}
      \right. & \forall\, v \in V
      \end{align*}

   For nodes other than source and
   destination this constraint represents  flow conservation:
   total flow out from each node must be equal to the total incoming flow.
   For the source node the constraint corresponds to  the definition
   of the variable :math:`\var{val}` as the value of the flow.
   Similarly  for the equation associated with the terminal node.
   
   * Bounds on the flows:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
	 
      \begin{align*}
      \param{Fmin}_{ij} \leq \var{f}_{ij} & \leq \param{Fmax}_{ij} &
      \forall \, (i, j) \in E
      \end{align*}

|
   :model:`Objective:`  maximize the flow value:
|

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \[
      \max \var{val}
      \]

If there were multiple source nodes (or multiple
destinations) in the network, it would be easy to
build an equivalent single source -- single destination one 
adding a dummy source node connected to
each source node and a dummy destination node with arcs entering from
all destinations; these added arcs should have no bound on maximum
capacity.


.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.6, auto,swap]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {1/0/s1,2/0/A,3/0/t3,1/1/s2,2/1/t1,3/1/t2}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {$\name$};
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0.5/0/S1,1/1.5/S2,2/1.5/T1,3.5/0/T3,3.5/1/T2}
   \node  (\name) at (\x,\y) {};
   \foreach \source/\dest/\cap in
   {s1/A/5,s1/t1/3,s1/s2/4,s2/t1/6,A/t1/3,A/t3/2,A/t2/4} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {\cap} (\dest); 
   \foreach \source/\dest in
   {S1/s1,t3/T3,S2/s2,t1/T1,t2/T2,t3/T3} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node {} (\dest); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

Adding two dummy nodes the problem is equivalent to finding a maximum
flow in the following network:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.4, auto,swap]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0/0.5/s,3.5/1/t,1/0/s1,2/0/A,3/0.5/t3,1/1/s2,2/1/t1,3/0/t2}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {$\name$};
   %\foreach \x / \y / \name in {0.5/0/S1,1/1.5/S2,2/1.5/T1,3.5/0/T3,3.5/1/T2}
   %node[vertex]  (\name) at (\x,\y) {};
   \foreach \source/\dest/\cap in
   {s1/A/5,s1/t1/3,s1/s2/4,s2/t1/6,A/t1/3,A/t3/2,A/t2/4} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {\cap} (\dest); 
   \foreach \source/\dest in
   {s/s1,t3/t,s/s2,t1/t,t2/t,t3/t} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {$\infty$} (\dest); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

   
An alternative but equivalent way to define the maximum  flow problem
is to connect the terminal node 
back to the source node through an arc with unlimited maximum capacity:
by imposing a zero flow balance on all nodes, including
source and terminal, we get a "closed" network
in which the circulating flow is conserved at every node; the value of
the flow is the flow along the fictitious arc :math:`(t, s)` .
 
Consider the example introduced at the beginning of this section: 
we might represent the same example also as:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.6, auto,swap]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name in {0/1/s,1/2/A,1/0/B,2/1/t}
   \node[vertex] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\name};
   \foreach \source/\dest/\flow/\cap in
   {s/A/4/4,s/B/5/8,A/B/2/5,A/t/2/7,B/t/7/7} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {\flow:\cap} (\dest);
   \path[->,very thick,blue] (t) edge [bend right] node[weight] {9:$\infty$} (s);
   \end{tikzpicture}

where an arc has been added from the destination to the source node
carrying all of the flow. A network of this kind is called  *circulation*
network, and it is characterized by the fact that the balance is zero
everywhere.

The maximum flow model finds many direct applications to, e.g.,
water  distribution networks, urban traffic flows, the design of
emergency exits from public buildings.

It is important to observe that the maximum flow model is indeed
a special case of the minimum cost flow model: in fact,
if we consider variable :math:`\var{val}` as the value of a flow
along  arc :math:`(t, s)`, the constraints are the standard ones of the
flow problems (with zero balance on all nodes); the objective function
to be minimized can be associated to the maximum flow by imposing zero
cost on every arc, with the exception of the fictitious
arc :math:`(t, s)` to which a unit cost -1 is assigned.

Denoting as usual by :math:`A` the incidence matrix of the graph, the
problem can be written as

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \max_{\var{f},\var{val} } \var{val} \\
   A \var{f} + (\mathbf{e}_t-\mathbf{e}_s) \var{val}  & = 0  \\
   \param{Fmin } \leq \var{f} & \leq \param{Fmax}
   \end{align*}

From this equivalence it is 
immediately seen that if the minimum and maximum capacities on arcs
are integer valued, then all  basic feasible  solutions are integers, and, in particular,
an optimal basic solution will be integer.

--------------------------------
Dual of the maximum flow problem
--------------------------------

The standard maximum flow problem
contains two groups of constraints,  one corresponding to
flow conservation, with an equation for each node of the
network; the second one, associated to the maximum capacity,  with an
inequality for each arc (we will omit minimum capacity in this part,
assuming a simple non negativity constraint for every flow variable).

In the dual there will be, thus, two groups of variables,
associated respectively with the nodes and the arcs of the
graph. Denoting by
:math:`\mathvar{\lambda}` and :math:`\mathvar{\gamma}` the dual
variables associated, respectively, with the balance and maximum flow
constraints, the following dual is quite easily obtained:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min \sum_{(i, j) \in E} \param{Fmax}_{ij} \mathvar{\gamma}_{ij} &
   \label{eq: dual-maxflow} \\ 
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{i} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{j} - \mathvar{\gamma}_{ij}
   & \leq0 & \forall \, (i, j) & \in E \nonumber \\ 
   \mathvar{\lambda}_{s} - \mathvar{\lambda}_{t} & \geq1 \nonumber \\
   \mathvar{\gamma}_{ij} & \geq0 & \forall \, (i, j) & \in E \nonumber
   \end{align*}

A possible interpretation of this dual is the following.
Consider the design of an electrical circuit in which it is required
to determine the maximum voltages associated with each arc. In
particular, assume that  a tension with value  1 is applied
between  nodes :math:`s` and :math:`t`; we wish to find an
upper bound :math:`\mathvar{\gamma}_{ij}` to the voltage at the
extremes of each arc. The cost of  each arc 
is assumed to grow linearly with the difference of potential (or
tension), with a coefficient
:math:`\param{Fmax}_{ij}`.

It can be shown that every basic feasible solutions of this problem, and, thus, also
at least one optimal solution, is binary.

Furthermore, it can be shown that in each basic  solution,
the set  nodes of the graph for which 
:math:`\mathvar{\lambda}_{i} = 1`  are associated to a so called
:math:`s - t` - section. An :index:`section` is defined as
a bi--partition of the set of nodes :math:`(W,\overline{W}): W \subset V`
that separates the source
from the terminal: :math:`s \in W, t \not\in W`.

Any such bi-partition also "cuts" a certain
number of arcs, some of which are "forward" arcs (with the first node
in set :math:`W` and the other outside this set). Forward arcs cut by
the bi-partition are arcs :math:`(i,j) \in E` such
that :math:`i \in W, j \not\in W`.   Analogously, we might define
"backward" arcs characterized by   :math:`i \not\in W, j \in W`.

We define the  :index:`capacity`  of a
cut as  the sum of the maximum capacities of the forward arcs
across the section.

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \textrm{Cap}(W,\overline{W}) & = \sum_{(i,j) \in E: i \in W, j \not\in
   W} \param{Fmax}_{i,j}
   \end{align*}

It is possible, although not trivial, to see  that the dual of the 
maximum flow problem corresponds to the problem of determining a cut of
minimum capacity; this cut is indeed a "bottleneck" in the
network. That is, in the optimal solution  variables :math:`\mathvar{\lambda}`
whose optimal value is equal to one  correspond to the indicator function of a
minimum capacity
bi-partition of nodes; the  arcs associated
to variables :math:`\mathvar{\gamma}`  are the "forward" arcs
from that section. From the theory on maximum flows, it can be proven
that in an optimal cut all forward arcs carry the maximum possible
flow, while all backward arcs are at their minimum. Extending the
definition of flow through a section as the difference between the
flows on forward arcs and the flows on backward arcs, it can be shown
that this flow is constant and equal to the value of the flow through
the network. The following figure pictorially represents the
situation.

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.25]
   \foreach \x / \y / \name / \colnode in
   {0/1/s/green!25,1/2/A/green!25,1/0/B/green!25,3/2/C/green!25,3/0/D/red!50,4/1/t/red!50} 
   \node[vertex,\colnode] (\name) at (\x,\y) {\textcolor{black}{\name}};
   \foreach \source /  \dest / \flow / \capac in
   {s/A/2/10,s/B/8/8,A/B/2/3,A/C/0/4,B/D/2/2,B/C/8/9,C/t/8/8,D/C/0/3,D/t/2/4} 
   \path[arc] (\source) -- node[weight] {$\flow$ : \capac} (\dest); 
   \node[vertex] (i) at (1,-1)  {$i$};
   \node[vertex] (j) at (3,-1) {$j$};
   \path[arc] (i) -- node[weight] {$f_{ij} : Fmax_{ij}$} (j);
   \path[arc,red] (B) -- node[weight]  {\textcolor{black}{2 : 2}} (D);
   \path[arc,red] (C) -- node[weight]  {\textcolor{black}{8 : 8}}(t);
   \path[arc,yellow] (D)  -- node[weight]  {\textcolor{black}{0 : 3}} (C);
   \draw[dotted] (.5,-1) -- (3.5,2);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Here the optimal (maximum) flow is 10 units; :math:`\{s,A,B,C\}` is
a minimum capacity
section, with forward arcs
:math:`(C,t),(B,t)`, both carrying the maximum possible flow, and
backward arc :math:`(D,C)` with a null flow. The capacity of this
cut is 10 and it is quite evident that no additional unit of flow is
feasible, as this cut limits the overall flow to a maximum of 10.


The solution to the above example was found by solving a standard
maximum flow problem, coded, e.g., as follows:
   
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/maxflow.mod
   :caption: maxflow.mod
   :language: ampl

with the following data:
   
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/maxflow.dat
   :caption: maxflow.dat
   :language: ampl

Here, again, it is worth remembering that solving maximum flow
problems with linear optimization solvers is in general not a
suggested practice, as much more advanced specialized algorithms do
exist. However, being able to model this problem as a linear
optimization one, might turn out to be  useful when dealing with more
general applications which include a maximum flow component as a part
of a larger model.

Similarly to what we did in the chapters devoted to pure linear
optimization problems, here we start a group of sections devoted to
specific models and applications. This way from one side we introduce
important applications of mathematical optimization models and their
formulations. On another side we aim at guiding the reader towards
acquiring specific modeling skills. This way we hope that when
modeling a complex real life problem the building blocks introduced in
these chapters will form a rich enough set of modeling tools.

************************
The fixed charge problem
************************
 
In some applications although it is reasonable to assume the cost
is  linear there might arise a problem of
modeling a discontinuity at zero.
Consider, as an example,  a production problem, like that
already presented in chapter :ref:`Structured linear optimization models`.

Production of a particular finished product, sometimes,
involves a cost which is proportional to the quantity to be
produced; this is often associated to labor time or  to the time
spent consuming some of the available resources. But sometimes
a "fixed charge"  is paid at the very start of production.
This cost is a constant which needs to be paid only if the production
level is strictly positive.
As an example, often a machine needs some start-up or set-up time
before being ready to produce. This time, which is non productive, can
be associated to a cost which needs to be paid independently on the
quantity to be produced, provided that this quantity is non zero.
Examples might be  warming up a plant, staff training, or equipment or
tool change
in a machine. We can formally describe the contribution to the total cost
due to the decision to produce :math:`\var{x}` units of a given  product
as

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
   C(\var{x}) = \left\{
   \begin{array}[c]{ll}
   c \var{x} + \param{K} & \text{ if } \var{x}> 0 \cr
   0 & \text{ otherwise}
   \end{array}
   \right.
   \end{align*}
 
This function, if the fixed cost :math:`\param{K}` is non zero, is not continuous,
although it can be proven to be *concave*.

 .. tikz::
      
      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
      \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (10,7);
      \draw[thick,->] (-0.2,0) -- (10.2,0) node[below right] {$x$};
      \draw[thick,->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,7.2) node[above left] {$C(x)$};
      \fill[blue] (0,0) circle(2pt);
      \draw[blue, very thick]  (0,1.5) -- (10,6.5);
      \draw[<->]  (-.3,0) -- node[above,rotate=90]  {$K$} (-.3,1.5);
      \draw[dotted] (2,2.5) -- (3,2.5);
      \draw[<->]  (3,2.5) -- node[right] {$c$} (3,3);
      \end{tikzpicture}

Through the introduction of an auxiliary 
binary variable it is possible to correctly formulate such a  cost function.
Taking into consideration the modeling examples introduced in chapter
:ref:`Using binary variables in logical constraints` 
a binary variable :math:`\mathvar{\delta}`  is introduced and the
following is required:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{x} \leq \param{M} \mathvar{\delta}
   \end{align*}
   
Here :math:`\param{M}` is a sufficiently large constant, e.g., an upper
bound on the production quantity. This way we have formulated, in a
linear way, the logical constraint

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{x} & \leq \param{M} \\
   \var{x} > 0 & \implies \mathvar{\delta} = 1 
   \end{align*}

Thus the indicator variable :math:`\mathvar{\delta}` is forced to 1
when the event :math:`\var{x}> 0` occurs. This binary variable might then
be used in the objective function to switch on the fixed charge:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min  \sum_j c_j \var{x}_j + \sum_j \param{K}_j \mathvar{\delta}_j  \\
   \var{x}_j & \leq \param{M}_j \mathvar{\delta}_j &  \forall \, j \\
   \var{x}_j & \geq0 \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_j & \in \{0,1\} \\
   \var{x} &\in X
   \end{align*}
   
where :math:`X` denotes other constraints  of the model.
It is worth observing that this model is not "perfect":
in fact, while the constraints correctly implement the logical
constraint, 
they are not
enough to guarantee that if :math:`\var{x}_j = 0` then
the corresponding :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_j = 0`.
Thus, in this model it is possible to obtain feasible 
solutions in which although there is no production for a certain
product, nonetheless a fixed charge  is included
(:math:`\var{x}_j = 0,  \mathvar{\delta}_j = 1`).

This modeling error is
irrelevant in this application. In fact, even if it is true that there can
exist feasible solutions with zero production and not null  fixed charge,
thanks to the  minimization of the objective function, these solutions will be
discarded in favor of similar, cheaper, solutions with zero fixed charge.
In other words, although the feasible set is larger then the feasible
set of the original problem, the optimal solutions will be correct,
thanks to the positivity of the fixed charge.

In some cases, however, the role of the indicator variable in the model might be
more complex; it might be involved in different constraints  and
it might  not automatically be driven  to zero when production is null.

In these cases,  an exact formulation of the fixed charge  model would be necessary
and an additional logical constraint would be required:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{x} = 0 &\implies \mathvar{\delta} = 0
   \end{align*}
 
As we have already seen, this logical constraint cannot be exactly
translated by means of a
finite number of linear constraints. A
solution, which is only partially satisfactory, consists in transforming the
constraint :math:`\var{x}> 0` into
:math:`\var{x} \geq \varepsilon`, where :math:`\epsilon> 0` is a 
small enough constant.

In this case it is possible to introduce a
constraint that represents the logical implication

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{x} &\geq 0 \\
   \mathvar{\delta} = 1 & \implies \var{x} \geq \epsilon
   \end{align*}

Choosing the upper bound :math:`\param{M}` requires some 
additional care. From a purely logical point of view,   this
constant plays the role of :math:`+ \infty`;  it is, in other words,
a value large enough  to make the constraint
:math:`\var{x} \leq \param{M}` redundant.
From the computational point of view the
choice of this constant might have an
influence on the effective possibility
of solving large scale problems in acceptable computational times.
It is important to choose the value of the constant :math:`\param{M}` in
such a way that, although it should be large enough not to limit in
any way feasible solutions, it must nonetheless be the lowest possible
in order not to generate too weak a relaxation.
In fact, consider a simple example. Assume that in a fixed charge
problem a production variable :math:`\var{x}` has an upper bound
equal to, say, 5. Then each of the following logical constraints:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \var{x} & \leq 5 \mathvar{\delta} \\
   \var{x} & \leq 10 \mathvar{\delta} \\
   \var{x} & \leq 100 \mathvar{\delta} 
   \end{align*}

when coupled with :math:`0 \leq \var{x} \leq 5, \mathvar{\delta} \in
\{0,1\}`
produce exactly the
same set of feasible solutions. However, when relaxing the integrality
requirement on the binary variable the resulting polyhedra are
different and, in particular, the first one is stronger, then the
second, which is stronger than the third.


 .. tikz::
      
      \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=4]
      \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (1,6);
      \draw[thick,->] (-0.2,0) -- (1.1,0) node[below right] {$\delta$};
      \draw[thick,->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,6.2) node[above left] {$x$};
      \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (1,0) -- (1,5) -- (0,5) -- (0,0);

      \node[above] at (.5,5) {\small{C}};
      \node[above] at (.05,5) {\small{D}};
      \end{tikzpicture}


In the figure, the feasible set is represented in green and it
consists of the origin O and the segment (A,B); the relaxed polyhedra
associated to the three formulations above are, respectively, those
with vertices  (O,A,B), (O,A,B,C), (O,A,B,D). (O,A,B** is ideal, as it
is the smallest possible polyhedron including the feasible set.
On the contrary, the other two polyhedra contain vertices which are
not feasible.

**********
Lot sizing
**********

An immediate application of the fixed charge model can be found in
production planning. The :index:`lot sizing` problem consists in
deciding production levels (lot sizes) in order to be able to satisfy
a known external demand, taking into account capacity and costs. The
most basic lot sizing model is the following:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min & \sum_{t=1}^T  (\mathpar{p}_t \var{x}_t + \mathpar{q}_t
   \mathvar{\delta}_t + \mathpar{h}_t 
   \var{s}_t)  \\
   \var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t  & = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t & \forall\, &t\\
   \var{s}_0 = \var{s}_T & = 0 \\
   \var{x}_t & \leq  \param{M}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t & \forall\, &t\\
   \var{x}_t & \geq 0 \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_t & \in \{0,1\} \\
   \var{s}_t & \geq 0
   \end{align*}

where (in the following, :math:`t` always denotes a time period
within the time horizon):

* :math:`T` is the finite time horizon, i.e., the planning period
* :math:`\var{x}_t` is the production level at the beginning of
  time period :math:`t`
* :math:`\var{s}_t` is the inventory level at the end of the period
* :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_t` is the fixed charge binary variable for the
  period, used to add a fixed cost whenever the production
  in a time period is different from zero
* :math:`\mathpar{d}_t` is the (known or estimated) demand for the
  period
* :math:`\mathpar{p}_t,\mathpar{q}_t, \mathpar{h}_t` are, respectively,
  the unit production cost, the fixed charge, the unit inventory cost
* :math:`\mathpar{M}_t` is the upper bound required in order to
  correctly formulate the fixed charge logical constraint at each
  period.

Classical lot sizing models are usually analyzed depending on a major
assumption. In many cases the problems are assumed to be
*uncapacitated*. By this we mean the fact that there is no strict
limit on production capacity in any period, and, similarly, there are
no constraints on inventories. The assumption of no limits on the
production capacity might seem to be contradictory with respect to the
inclusion, in the model, of an upper bound on production, which is
necessary in order to correctly formulate the logical
constraint. However, this upper bound, in uncapacitated models, is
defined as

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \mathpar{M}_t & = \sum_{i=t}^T \mathpar{d}_i
   \end{align*}

This assumption derives from cost considerations: there is in fact no
need to produce, at any time period, more than what will be demanded
in the current and future periods. Any extra production, beyond this
limit, would not be used to satisfy demand and will generate an
additional cost. So, by using this parameter as an upper bound on
production levels, a redundant constraint is generated. To be precise,
the upper bound is redundant for any optimal solution. Using a similar
upper bound does not really limit production: at any time period it is
assumed that production can be set to any reasonable level, without
any strict limitation. It can be easily seen that, thanks to this
upper bound, also the inventory is limited. But, again, this is not a
limited capacity constraint on the inventory, but simply a consequence
of the assumption on the model.

From a purely modeling point of view, including an upper bound on
production or on the inventory would be quite trivial. However it is
known that the  lot-sizing optimization problem is easy to solve
in the uncapacitated case, while it becomes, in general, hard as soon
as strict bounds on production or inventory levels are introduced.

We are not going to go into much detail on the algorithmic aspects of
lot-sizing. It seems worth recalling, however, that the uncapacitated
case remains easily  solvable even when the objective function is
*concave* in terms of production and inventory levels.

We recall that concave functions are frequently encountered as cost
functions in applied problems. Let us first give some definitions. A
set :math:`S \subseteq \R^n` is called :index:`convex set` if

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \[
   x\in S, y \in S \implies \lambda x + (1-\lambda y) \in S,
   \forall\, \lambda \in [0,1]
   \]

A convex set is any set characterized by the fact that given any two
elements in the set, also the segment connecting them belongs to the
set.  A :index:`convex function` over a convex set :math:`S` is a
function such that:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) & \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
   & \forall\,x,y, \in S, \lambda \in [0,1]
   \end{align*}

while a :index:`concave function` is any function such that

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) & \geq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
   & \forall\,x,y, \in S, \lambda \in [0,1]
   \end{align*}

It can be easily seen that for concave functions (here we limit to
functions of a single variable, but a more general result might be
stated)
the following holds:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   f( x + 1) - f(x) & \leq  f(x) - f(x-1)
   \end{align*}

and this means that the *increment*  in the function is not increasing
with its argument. This situation is very common in industrial cost
functions where there usually is some sort of a scale effect which
makes production, or inventory, display a marginal cost variation
which is non increasing with the quantity. It is some sort of a
quantity discount: one additional unit produced will marginally cost
less as the production level increases.

It is easy to proof that the fixed charge objective function is indeed
a concave function over the set of non negative reals.

A well known result in lot sizing theory is that, provided that the
problem is uncapacitated, if the objective function is a concave
function of the inventory and the production levels, then the optimal
production policy can be efficiently found (i.e., in polynomial
time). We suggest the interested reader to consult the fundamental
book :cite:`pochet2006` on this subject. Here it might suffice to say
that there exist many efficient algorithms to optimally solve the
uncapacitated lot sizing problem, the best known of which is the
:index:`Wagner-Within` algorithm, which is based on dynamic
programming.

It is also important to observe that  the problem is "easy"
and can be efficiently solved for long time horizons even in a much
more general form than the linear one considered here. However, the
formulation given above is far from being ideal and, in general,
solving a  problem of realistic size using  that model with a general
purpose mixed integer linear optimization solver might be extremely
demanding.
We cannot here go into details on strong formulations for this
problem. It is sufficient so say that a strong (ideal) formulation of
the uncapacitated lot sizing problem can indeed be obtained. However,
its formulation requires an exponential number of constraints in the
space of the original variable (although ideal formulations of
polynomial size exist when the problem is reformulated in a higher
dimensional space). Thus,
the direct use of such a formulation for a large scale problem is out
of question. It is nonetheless possible to define a computational
procedure which can be recursively called to sequentially add a small number of
constraints to the original formulation until the optimal solution is
found.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Branch and cut - dynamical simplex method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This kind of procedure is quite common in combinatorial
  optimization and it is worth devoting a paragraph to a quick
  description.
  Assume a formulation of a
  problem is given in  which constraints are partitioned into a set of
  "easy" constraints, quite limited in number, and another set of
  constraints, usually of huge cardinality.
  
  Let us denote these two sets by :math:`F_0, F`:
  
  .. math::
     :nowrap:
	
     \begin{align*}
     \min c^T \var{x}  & \\
     a_i^T \var{x} & \leq b_i  & i \in F_0 \\
     \alpha_i^T \var{x} & \leq \beta_i & i \in F
     \end{align*}
     
  Usually, even if not necessarily,  integrality
  requirements for a subset of variables might be present. The idea of the dynamical
  simplex method, which is the basis of  the Branch and Cut algorithm, is to start by
  solving a relaxation of the problem (possibly a good one) obtained by
  eliminating the large family of constraints with index in
  :math:`F` (and, possibly, the integrality requirement too).
	
  .. math::
     :nowrap:
     
     \begin{align*}
     x^\star_0 & \in \arg \min c^T \var{x}  \\
     a_i^T \var{x} & \leq b_i  & i \in F_0 
     \end{align*}
  
  The optimal solution of this problem might be a feasible solution or not. If
  it is feasible, i.e., if it satisfies also all of the constraints
  which have been eliminated, than it is an optimal solution to the
  original problem. Otherwise, there must exist at least an inequality,
  in family :math:`F`, which is not satisfied by the current
  solution.

  Assume we have available a procedure, called a :index:`separation
  procedure` which, given a point :math:`\bar{x}`, either
  
  * certifies that :math:`\bar{x}` satisfies all of the inequalities
    indexed by :math:`F`
  * or returns at least an index :math:`\bar{\imath} \in F` such
    that
    
    .. math::
       :nowrap:
       
       \begin{align*}
       \alpha_{\bar{\imath}}^T \bar{x} & > \beta_{\bar{\imath}}
       \end{align*}
    
  (and possibly returns many of these indices and, if at all possible,
  some of those associated to the "maximally violated" inequalities)
  
  Let us denote this procedure by :math:`CutGenerator(x,F)` and
  assume it returns a set of indices of violated inequalities, if any
  exists, or the empty set if all are satisfied.

  Thus a cutting plane algorithm might be built this way:
  
  #.  let, as before, :math:`x_0^\star` be an optimal solution of the initial
      relaxed problem
  #.  let :math:`k:= 0`
  #.  let :math:`F_1 = \emptyset`
  #.  While :math:`C = CutGenerator(x_k^\star,F) \ne \emptyset`:
  
      a. let :math:`k := k+1`
      b. let :math:`F_1 = F_1 \cup C`
      c. let :math:`F = F \setminus C`
      d. solve:
      
	 .. math::
	    :nowrap:
	    
	    \begin{align*}
	    x^\star_k & \in \arg \min c^T \var{x}  \\
	    a_i^T \var{x} & \leq b_i  & i \in F_0  \\
	    \alpha_i^T \var{x} & \leq \beta_i & i \in F_1
	    \end{align*}
     
  #. End While
  
  
  In the above algorithmic scheme, the CutGeneration procedure is
  repeatedly called to separate the current solution. In fact, all of
  the inequalities returned by this procedure are violated in the
  current optimal solution. Thus, adding these inequalities to the pool
  of current inequalities, will make that solution infeasible. Thus the
  procedure, at every iteration, is granted to deliver a different
  solution to the current relaxation. It is hoped, and this is what
  happens in practice, that the whole algorithm will terminate well
  before all of the inequalities of the original set :math:`F` have
  been added.
  
  This has become the standard way to approach difficult combinatorial
  optimization problems. What is needed is, from one side, a family of
  valid inequalities, possibly describing the ideal formulation of the
  problem or, at least, a subset of the inequalities defining such ideal
  representation. This is clearly a modeling problem. From the
  algorithmic point of view, it is necessary to have available a
  CutGeneration procedure which avoids checking, one by one, all of the
  inequalities in search of a violated one or of a proof of
  feasibility. This, sometimes, can be done efficiently, while in some
  other cases we must be satisfied by an heuristic CutGeneration
  procedure, one which is not granted to find a violated inequality even
  if one exists. An important result in computational complexity theory
  states that an efficient separation procedure exists if and only if an
  efficient optimization algorithm exists for the original problem.
  In other words, if a problem is efficiently solvable, as it is the
  case of the uncapacitated 
  lot-sizing with linear costs and fixed charge, then there
  should exist a formulation and an efficient cut generation algorithm
  to solve it through the repeated execution of linear optimization
  algorithms.

  On the opposite side, if a problem is inherently difficult, as it is
  the case, in general, for finite capacity production planning
  problems, even if the ideal formulation might be known, finding a
  violated inequality or checking they are all satisfied is in general
  hard.

  This negative result should not however be too much emphasized. Modern
  exact optimization procedures do in fact use this kind of strategies,
  in order to solve specific instances of hard problems. These are
  worst-case results, and they do not prevent single problems to be
  solved quite efficiently by using a similar scheme.

  This framework is also a justification for presenting linear integer
  models for problems, like the lot sizing, for which efficient
  algorithms do exist which are somewhat unrelated to linear
  optimization.

  The reason is the following: if we just needed to solve an
  uncapacitated lot sizing problem, it is quite out of question that the
  best choice would be to use the Wagner-Within algorithm, or some
  other, even more efficient,  available method. However, when trying to
  solve more general lot-sizing problems, knowing a set of good quality
  inequalities as well as a procedure to separate an infeasible solution
  might prove extremely important in the solution of realistic large
  size problems.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced formulations for the lot sizing model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not the case to present here the ideal formulation of the lot
sizing model, for which we refer to the relevant literature on the
subject. Introducing this formulation, in fact, would require us to
make a quite long digression on valid inequalities for the problem,
which seems to be out of scope in this notes, mainly devoted to
modeling issues. Another reason for not introducing this formulation
is the fact that, as a consequence of the exponential number of its
constraints, it cannot be used as-is in a model, but included in a
specialized algorithmic procedure of the kind briefly described
above.

It might be worth, however, to introduce a different model for the
problem which is indeed ideal and not too large in dimension. The
model is based on a *multi-commodity flow* formulation. When a decision
on a production level is taken at a specific time instant, we might
follow the material flow from production up to demand
consumption. This flow usually will be split into some flow of
production going directly to satisfy part of the current demand, and a
set of flows that, passing through a few periods in the inventory,
will eventually contribute to partially satisfy future demand. The
idea of the multi-commodity flow formulation is to make these flows
explicit. We label each production and each inventory variable with
two indices: the current time period, and the time period at which the
material will be delivered to satisfy the demand. Thus, e.g.,
:math:`\var{x}_{3,5}` represents production in period 3 which will
be used to satisfy (part of)
the demand of period 5; :math:`\var{s}_{2,6}` is the quantity of
material in the inventory at the end of period 2 which will be used to
satisfy (part of) the demand of period 6.

The following illustration might be useful to understand the
formulation. Consider the following feasible flow in a 3 period
planning problem:

Here, 13 units are produced at time 1, some which to satisfy the
demand of period 1, some for period 2 and 1 for  the
demand of period 3. Another production run is in period 3, in which 6
units are produced to satisfy, with the inventory left over from
previous periods, the demand of period 3.
If we split the single origin/destination flows, we obtain:

   \end{tikzpicture}    


Denoting by :math:`\param{d}_{s,t} = \sum_{p=s}^t \mathpar{d}_s` the cumulative
demand between periods :math:`s`  and  :math:`t`, the model can be
written as:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min &\sum_{s=1}^T \sum_{t=s}^T (\mathpar{p}_s \var{x}_{st}  + \mathpar{h}_s
   \var{s}_{st}) + \sum_{t=1}^T \mathpar{q}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t  \\
   \var{s}_{s-1,t} + \var{x}_{s,t}  & =  \var{s}_{st} &
   \forall\, &1 \leq s < t \leq T\\
   \var{s}_{t-1,t} + \var{x}_{t,t}  & = \mathpar{d}_t &
   \forall\, &1 \leq t  \leq T\\
   \var{x}_{st} & \leq \param{d}_{t,T} \mathvar{\delta}_s & \forall\, &s
   \leq t\\
   \var{x}_{st} & \geq 0 \\
   \mathvar{\delta}_t & \in \{0,1\} \\
   \var{s}_{st} & \geq 0
   \end{align*}

The model follows quite closely the standard one, and the link between
the two is obtained by considering the relations

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \var{x}_i & = \sum_{t=i}^T \var{x}_{it} \\
   \var{s}_i & = \sum_{t=i+1}^T \var{s}_{it}
   \end{align*}

In the above model it is assumed that the initial inventory is 0;
in any case, if  the initial inventory is  no more than
:math:`\mathpar{d}_1` it can  be reduced to  zero,
partially compensating the initial demand. Under the assumption of
zero initial inventory, it is also required to add some border
constraints on the inventory variables associated to the initial
period:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \var{s}_{0i} & = 0 & \forall\,i & = 1, T
   \end{align*}

and the following one for the impossibility of having a storage "going
back in time" (recall that we used to define the storage at the end of
the period):

.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \var{s}_{ii} & = 0  & \forall\,i
   \end{align*}
 
In the model above, the objective is quite immediately recognized as
perfectly equivalent to the original one.  The first group of
constraints represents the flow of inventories inside the network,
before their exit as partial demand satisfaction. Those constraint
states that the inventory flow of products whose destination is a
future demand either comes from current production or from the
previous period, all with the same destination in the future. The
second group of constraints is associated to demand satisfaction, and
it states that all of the demand of a period needs to be satisfied
with the current production destined to current demand, or with the
products stored in the inventory and destined to satisfy current
demand. No inventory can be left over at this stage.
The following constraint is a set of logical constraints imposing that
at any time period, if there is a non null production, whichever the
destination, then the logical variable of that time period needs to be
set to 1. This variable is then used to add the fixed charge cost to
the objective.

This *multi commodity* formulation has a larger number of variables
and constraints: :math:`O(T^2)` instead of :math:`O(T)` of the
original formulation. However, it can be proven that this formulation
is *ideal*: relaxing the integrality constraints on the logical
variables, every (optimal) basic feasible solution satisfies also the
binary constraints. Thus it is possible to solve to optimality this
problem  with a single execution of a linear optimization algorithm
like, e.g., the simplex method.  It is worth recalling that, if our
aim was to solve an instance of this problem, even this ideal
formulation might not be a good choice, in particular for large time
horizons. In fact efficient specialized algorithms exist which allow
for a very fast solution even at large size. However, when there are
complicating constraints, like, e.g., finite capacity or additional
logical constraints, it might be useful to add those constraints to a
good formulation, like this one, and to start from this for a branch
and bound algorithm. We recall again, however, that it is possible to
obtain an ideal representation of the problem in the original variable
space, without the necessity of squaring the number of variables and
constraints.

The following code contains an example of implementation of the
original lot
sizing model:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U.mod
   :caption: LS-U.mod
   :language: ampl

while the following one is an implementation using the multi-commodity
flow formulation (notice we have not imposed integrality on the
logical variables):

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U-multicommodity.mod
   :caption: LS-U-multicommodity.mod
   :language: ampl
   
If we run both models with the following data:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U-big.dat
   :caption: LS-U-big.dat
   :language: ampl
   :lines: 1-10
:math:`\dots`
      
.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U-big.dat
:language: ampl
   :lines: 54-77
   
the first model returns:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U.out
   :caption: LS-U.out
   :language: ampl

while the multi-commodity flow based one:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/LS-U-multicommodity.out
   :caption: LS-U.out
   :language: ampl
It must be said that modern solvers employ a large set of
preprocessing techniques in order to strengthen the initial
formulation and transform it into one which is as close as reasonably
possible to the ideal one. This is why, employing a state-of-the-art
solver like, in this case, Gurobi, the difference between the two is
not striking. However we can observe that with the original
formulation a step of branch and bound is required, while with the
second  one the simplex method is enough.  The number of simplex
iterations in the second run is much lower than the analogous one in
the first. It must be said, however, that the first formulation has a
much smaller number of variables and constraints, so the real winner
in this case is not so evident. If we tried an older solver like,
e.g., glpsol, then the difference in the two runs would have been very significant.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Variants of production planning models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this part we would like to briefly list some additional modeling
possibilities and some extensions of the basic model, useful in
realistic production scenarios.

* Backlogs

  The first modeling variant we introduce is that related to allowing
  for part of the demand not to be satisfied in the period it was
  requested. It is possible, sometimes, to delay the delivery of part
  of the demand; of course, any delay will involve an additional
  cost. In order to model this situation, it is possible to consider
  the fact that this is quite symmetrical to the situation of the
  inventory. In the case of inventory, in fact, we are producing in
  advance with respect to the demand period; and the earlier we
  produce, the higher the storage cost will be. This is modeled through an
  inventory variable, with a cost, which models the flow of produced
  material "towards the future". In a completely analogous way,
  :index:`backlog` (which is the delayed delivery of products) can be
  thought of as an inventory which, from future production periods,
  flows "back" towards the satisfaction of a past demand. Every unit
  in this backward flow will have an associated backlog cost. Of
  course, products never travel back in time, but a backlog can be
  used to model production delayed by a few periods. A model with
  backlog is the following:
  

  .. math::
     :nowrap:
      
     \begin{align*}
     \min & \sum_{t=1}^T  (\mathpar{p}_t \var{x}_t + \mathpar{q}_t
     \mathvar{\delta}_t + \mathpar{h}_t 
     \var{s}_t + \mathpar{b}_t \var{r}_t)  \\
     \var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t  + \var{r}_t& = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t +
     \var{r}_{t-1}& \forall\, &t\\
     \var{s}_0 = \var{s}_T & = 0 \\
     \var{x}_t & \leq  \param{M}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t & \forall\, &t\\
     \mathvar{\delta}_t & \in \{0,1\} \\
     \var{x}_t, \var{s}_t, \var{r}_t & \geq 0
     \end{align*}

  Here we have included a new variable, :math:`\var{r}_t` to
  represent the quantity of material produced after period :math:`t`
  which is available either to satisfy the current demand or to go
  backward in time to satisfy previous demand.

  The following schematic representation should help understanding the
  balance equations:

  .. tikz::
     
     \begin{tikzpicture}[radius=3cm,auto,minimum height =1cm,scale=0.9]
     \newcommand{\tvar}[1]{{\color{red}{\mathbf{#1}}}}
     %\node (0) at (0,0) {\phantom{$T$}};
     \node[circle,draw] (1) at (2,0) {1};
     \node (a1) at (2,2) {};
     \node (b1) at (2,-2) {};
     \node[circle,draw] (2) at (4,0) {2};
     \node (a2) at (4,2) {};
     \node (b2) at (4,-2) {};
     \node[circle] (3) at (6,0) {\phantom{$T$}};
     \node[circle,draw] (T1) at (8,0) {\tiny{$T-1$}};
     \node[circle,draw] (T) at (10,0) {\tiny{$T$}};
     \node (at) at (10,2) {};
     \node (bt) at (10,-2) {};
     \path[draw,thick,blue,->] (1)  to[bend left] node
     {\tiny{$\tvar{s}_1$}}(2);
     \path[draw,thick,purple,->] (2)  to[bend left] node {\tiny{$\tvar{r}_1$}}(1);
     \path[draw,thick,blue,->,dotted] (2) to[bend left] node
     {\tiny{$\tvar{s}_2$}} (3);
     \path[draw,thick,purple,->,dotted] (3)  to[bend left] node
     {\tiny{$\tvar{r}_2$}}(2); 
     \path[draw,thick,blue,->,dotted] (3) to[bend left]
     node{\tiny{$\tvar{s}_{T-2}$}} (T1);
     \path[draw,thick,purple,->,dotted] (T1)  to[bend left] node {\tiny{$\tvar{r}_{T-2}$}}(3);
     \path[draw,thick,blue,->] (T1) to[bend left] node
     {\tiny{$\tvar{s}_{T-1}$}}(T);
     \path[draw,thick,purple,->] (T)  to[bend left] node
     {\tiny{$\tvar{r}_{T-1}$}}(T1); 
     \path[draw,->] (a1) -- node {\tiny{$\tvar{x}_1$}} (1);
     \path[draw,->] (1) -- node {\tiny{$d_1$}} (b1);
     \path[draw,->] (a2) -- node {\tiny{$\tvar{x}_2$}} (2);
     \path[draw,->] (2) -- node {\tiny{$d_2$}} (b2);
     \path[draw,->] (at) -- node {\tiny{$\tvar{x}_T$}} (T);
     \path[draw,->] (T) -- node {\tiny{$d_T$}} (bt);
     \end{tikzpicture}

  The backward arcs in the picture represent the flow of material
  produced after the demand period. It is in general assumed that on
  the borders of the planning periods, the backlog variable is zero.

  This model, similarly to the standard one, can be very easily solved
  when there is no strict constraint on finite capacities. Also for
  this model there exist alternative formulations, either in a larger
  dimensional space, similar to what has been introduced in the
  multi-commodity formulation above, or in the same space of variables,
  but with an ideal formulation with an exponential number of
  constraints.

* Startup cost

  We have already seen how to model a *setup* cost which is to be paid
  whenever production is positive. A :index:`startup cost` is
  different in that it is a cost to be paid whenever production is
  positive after a null production period.  Startup cost, in other
  words, is paid whenever production changes its state from zero to
  positive. It is quite common in plants with continuous production
  and represents a cost to be paid in order to take the production
  plant from a quiet state to an active state. On the contrary, setup
  costs can be thought of as similar costs, but for a plant which is
  always switched off at the end of the period, so that it needs to be
  paid at every production period, of course if there is any positive
  production.
  It is the case, as an example, of
  production plants working for 8 hours a day, which, every morning,
  need to be set up in order to be able to start production.

  A possibility to model startup costs is to introduce an additional
  binary variable, :math:`\var{z}_t` and to link it in such a way
  as to represent this change of state:

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=0 \land      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=1  &
     \implies \var{z}_t = 1
     \end{align*}

  This is equivalent to the logical expression:
  
  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=1 \lor  \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=0 \lor
      \var{z}_t = 1
     \end{align*}

  which can be formulated as the constraint

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     (1-\mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}) +      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}
     + \var{z}_t  & \geq 1
     \end{align*}

  or, simplifying, 
  
  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{z}_t  & \geq \mathvar{\delta}_{t-1} - \mathvar{\delta}_{t}
     \end{align*}

  The opposite implication :math:`\var{z}_t = 1 \implies
  \mathvar{\delta}_{t-1}=0 \land      \mathvar{\delta}_{t}=1` is not
  in general required, as the cost associated to the startup variable
  will forbid :math:`\var{z}_t` to be 1 if there is no startup situation.

  It might also be observed that, here, we used
  :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_t=0` as an indicator that in that period
  production is zero. But, we recall, in the original lot sizing model
  this implication was not imposed, as it was automatically true in
  optimal solutions, due to a similar reasoning as above: it is costly
  to set the variable to 1 when it is not necessary. In this case,
  however, some care needs to be taken, as we should consider whether
  it is still true that there is no incentive, in optimal solutions,
  to have :math:`\mathvar{\delta}_t=1` even when production is
  zero. And, indeed, now this might happen, in particular when the
  startup cost is significantly high: it might be convenient to set
  this variable to 1 just to avoid paying a startup cost. This is
  incorrect and, in this model, we need to add the requirement:

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{x}_t = 0 & \implies \mathvar{\delta}_t = 0
     \end{align*}

  which can be approximately formulated as


  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{x}_t &\geq  \varepsilon \mathvar{\delta}_t
     \end{align*}

* Startup time

  Another quite frequent effect of startup is that, not only a cost is
  incurred, but also production capacity is reduced, due to the time
  spent in starting the engine. We report here the example for
  startup,  because for setup the situation is easier. In fact, if,
  say, one hour of production is lost for setup, we can simply change
  the capacity of the production plant, reducing it to take into
  account this one hour loss. With startup the situation is different,
  as production capacity will be full for every period, except for
  those periods which immediately follow a change of state.

  Le us assume now that the startup cost model has been included, so that we
  can use variable :math:`\var{z}_t`  to indicate startup
  periods. If production capacity is denoted by :math:`\mathpar{C}_t`
  and the loss of production capacity due to startup is denoted by
  :math:`\mathpar{ST}_t`, then the logical constraint linking binary
  variables to production can be written as

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{x}_t & \leq \mathpar{C}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t - \mathpar{ST}_t \var{z}_t
     \end{align*}
     
  This way, when startup occurs, the upper bound on production is
  reduced accordingly.

* Minimum production levels

  In some production planning cases, when production is active, a
  minimum production level might be imposed. Take into account that,
  usually, an effect of the presence of setup costs is the fact that
  when production is active, production levels are non  negligible, to
  compensate for the setup cost. If, nonetheless, a minimum production
  level :math:`\mathpar{LB}_t` is required, this can be easily introduced  through a linear
  inequality:

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{x}_t & \geq \mathpar{LB}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t
     \end{align*}

  By the way, when present, this lower bound can take the place of the
  :math:`\varepsilon` parameter we had to introduce to model some of
  the logical constraints in previous sections. If we put together the
  maximum and minimum level requirements, the constraint turns out to
  be:

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \mathpar{LB}_t \mathvar{\delta}_t & \leq \var{x}_t \leq \mathpar{C}_t
     \mathvar{\delta}_t
     \end{align*}

  from which it is immediately seen that either the production is zero
  or otherwise it is within the interval :math:`[\mathpar{LB}_t, \mathpar{C}_t]`

* Safety stock

  A similar lower bound is frequently imposed on inventories too, in
  order to protect from uncertainties (in the demand, in the
  production, ...). The difference is that usually a safety stock is
  always required, and does not depend on other events or binary
  variables. It can thus be trivially imposed via

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{s}_t  & \geq \mathpar{SS}_t
     \end{align*}

* Unsatisfied demand.

  We have always assumed demand as a quantity to
  be delivered exactly, possibly with some delay, as we have seen
  before. However, we might as well turn the balance constraint into a
  "soft" one by allowing the demand not to be exactly satisfied. Of
  course this will imply a penalty in the objective function. The
  standard way to soften an equality can be used to obtain equations
  like the following one:

  .. math::
     :nowrap:

     \begin{align*}
     \var{s}_{t-1} + \var{x}_t & = \mathpar{d}_t + \var{s}_t  -
     \var{y}_t \\
     \var{y}_t & \geq 0
     \end{align*}

  The  non negative variable :math:`\var{y}_t`  subtracted on the
  right hand side represents the quantity of available product which
  is not used to satisfy the demand or to feed the inventory. If, as
  it is required, a positive cost is imposed on this variable in the
  objective function, then, if at all possible and convenient, demand will be
  satisfied and this variable will be left equal to zero. Otherwise,
  either for cost considerations, or in order to cope with
  limited production capacity in this and earlier periods, it might be
  convenient to use this variable, paying a cost, and avoid full
  demand satisfaction. Of course, an upper bound might be imposed to
  this variable in order to avoid too large a fraction of the demand
  not to be satisfied.
     
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced lot sizing models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will not go too much into details, in this chapter, on generalized
lot sizing models. But we would like to introduce at least a few formulation of realistic
production situations. In fact, real production planning problems
require us to take into account many different aspects, from the
multiplicity of products, to the different production phases, to the
availability of resources. In this part we will define a few such
models, in order to show the power of linear constraints to model even
very complex realistic situations. Of course, modeling is not solving,
and the computational aspects behind the possibility of actually
solving these models are complex and out of scope in this volume. In any case
we would like to recall that  modeling the whole
production planning problem as a single model might be extremely
beneficial, from a cost point of view; typical practical approaches in
this field proceed by decomposing the problem into sub-problems, easier
to solve, but whose interactions are neglected. This usually leads to
far from optimal solutions, and, thus, inefficiencies.
Small scale problems can be solved already from the models we will
introduce here, with general purpose mixed integer linear optimization
tools. Larger scale problems might require advanced algorithmic
implementations, or, possibly, improved formulations.


-----------------------------------
Master Production Scheduling models
-----------------------------------

:index:`MPS` (:index:`Master Production Scheduling`) models consist of a quite
straightforward generalization of lot sizing to take into account

*  limited resource availability
*  multiple products

These are two major extensions of the basic model. From one side,
multiple products are considered and their flow through the planning
period must be managed separately one from the other. It actually is
a multi-commodity flow problem. Having different products to consider would not be
a problem if they were completely independent. On the contrary,
dependence among decisions is needed, as, in general, these different
product flows need to access some limited resources. These might be
shared machines, personnel, prime material, budget ... In what follows we
formulate  a basic linear model to take into account both multiple
products as well as resources. We consider also some resource
consumption due to setup.

Let:

* :math:`i=1,\ldots,m` denote the  indices of different products to
  be planned simultaneously on the same plant
* :math:`k =1, \ldots,K` denote the set of indices of a set of
  resources which are shared among different products. These
  resources are available with only finite capacity, so conflicts
  arise for their usage, up to capacity
* :math:`\mathpar{L}_t^k` is the maximum available quantity of
  resource :math:`k` during period  :math:`t`. Depending on the
  resource consumption of various products, this amount cannot be
  exceeded during any single time period
* :math:`\mathpar{\alpha}^{ik}`:   the amount of resource :math:`k` which
  is necessary in order to produce one unit  of  product :math:`i`
* :math:`\mathpar{\beta}^{ik}` amount of resource :math:`k`  required for
  production setup relative to product  :math:`i`. Here it is
  assumed that each product type will generate a setup cost when its
  production is non zero. Different situations might be dealt with in
  quite  a similar way.

Given these parameters, a model might be formulated as follows, where
the superscript on variables denotes each product type:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \min &\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{i=1}^m (\mathpar{p}^i_t \var{x}^i_t +
   \mathpar{q}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t + \mathpar{h}^i_t \var{s}^i_t)  \\
   \var{s}^i_{t-1} + \var{x}^i_t  & = \mathpar{d}^i_t + \var{s}^i_t & \forall\, &i,t\\
   \var{x}^i_t & \leq  \mathpar{M}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t & \forall\, &i,t\\
   \sum_i \mathpar{\alpha}^{ik} \var{x}^i_t + \sum_i \mathpar{\beta}^{ik}

   \mathvar{\delta} & \in \{0,1\}^{mn} \\
   \var{s} & \in \R^{m(n+1)}_{+}
   \end{align*}

The first equation above is the standard inventory balance equation,
the only difference being the fact that it is replicated for each
product type: each product has its own production, inventory,
demand. The following inequalities are the logical constraints which
force the binary variable, for a product in a specific period, to
become 1 when the production of that product in that period is non
zero. Up to now, there was no linking between the different products:
up to here, different products are independent. The following
constraints, however, introduce the dependence: at every time period,
for each of the resources considered, the total amount of resources
consumed cannot be more than the available quantity. Resources are
consumed when production is non zero, and the consumption has been
assumed to be proportional to the quantity produced, with a
proportionality constant which depends on the product type. Moreover,
when there is a non zero production, there might be also a fixed
consumption of a resource due to setup.

A simple example of implementation, along with a small dataset is
reported in what follows:

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/MPS.mod
   :caption: MPS.mod
   :language: ampl

.. literalinclude:: AMPL/MPS.dat
   :caption: MPS.dat
   :language: ampl
   
Running a mixed integer linear optimization algorithm with these data,
the following solution is obtained:

.. tikz::

     \begin{tikzpicture}
     \node (S0) at (0,4) {\small{Shoes}};
     \node (T0) at (0,1) {\small{Shirts}};
     \foreach \t in {1,2,3,4,5} {
     \node[circle,draw] (S\t) at (\t,4) {\t};
     \node[circle,draw] (T\t) at (\t,1) {\t};
     }
     \foreach \t/\x/\d in {1/50/50,2/50/20,3/0/30,4/80/80,5/40/40}{
     \draw[->] (\t,5) node[above] {\tiny{\x}} -- (S\t);
     \draw[->] (S\t) -- (\t,3) node[below] {\tiny{\d}};
     }
     \draw[->] (S2) -- node[above]{\tiny{30}} (S3);
     %
     \foreach \t/\x/\d in {1/30/20,2/30/40,3/63/40,4/27/40,5/0/10}{
     \draw[->] (\t,2) node[above] {\tiny{\x}} -- (T\t);
     \draw[->] (T\t) -- (\t,0) node[below] {\tiny{\d}};
     }
     \draw[->] (T1) -- node[above]{\tiny{10}} (T2);
     \draw[->] (T3) -- node[above]{\tiny{23}} (T4);
     \draw[->] (T4) -- node[above]{\tiny{10}} (T5);
     \end{tikzpicture}
		   
From the picture above it is immediate to see that many properties
enjoyed by the standard lot sizing model here are no more valid. In
uncapacitated lot sizing it can be proven that at each period either
there exist a positive production or a positive inventory, but never
both. Here this is no more true.  A consequence of the basic property
of uncapacitated lot sizing is that production is always equal to the
sum of a set of future consecutive demands, which, again, is false in
a model like this one.

For what concerns resource consumption, the situation is the
following:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \textrm{Machine} \\
   \begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
   \hline \\
   t & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
   \textrm{Actual} & 93 & 93 & 71 & 120 & 45 \\
   \textrm{Avail}  & 100 & 140 & 100 & 120 & 60 \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \\
   \textrm{Personnel} \\
   \begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
   \hline\\
   t & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
   \textrm{Actual} & 80 & 80 & 63 & 107 & 40 \\
   \textrm{Avail}  & 150 & 80 & 70 & 120 & 60 \\ \hline
   \end{array}
   \end{align*}

from which it can be seen the both the Machine as well as the
Personnel resource are in some time periods used at maximum capacity.

-----------------------------
Material Requirement Planning
-----------------------------

The models presented above concern production planning with somewhat
monolithic and independent products. By this we mean that the unique
interaction among different products is due to the scarcity of some
resources, which are needed for different products.

In many situations, however, the situation is highly more
complex. Frequently a product is made through an assembling of several
intermediate products or parts. Sometimes production proceeds in
sequential stages (:index:`series production models`). In these cases
we might think, for each product, to a graph consisting of a single
path of successive productions, the final product at one stage being
the required material for the following one:

.. tikz::
   
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node[vertex,fill=red!25]  (0)  at (0,0) {1};
   \node[vertex,fill=red!25]  (1)  at (2,0) {2};
   \node[vertex,fill=red!25]  (2)  at (4,0) {3};
   \node[vertex,fill=green!25] (3) at (6,0) {\textcolor{blue}{4}};
   \path[arc] (0) -- (1); 
   \path[arc] (1) -- (2); 
   \path[arc] (2) -- (3); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

To cope with this situation, along with the usual balance constraints
for each (intermediate and final) product, temporal sequences need to
be taken into account, as production at downhill stages cannot be
started until the required production uphill has been completed.

In a more general situation, a final product might be composed of a
more complex set of intermediate products. The following picture
graphically represents a part assembly production model:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
   \foreach \name / \xx / \yy in {a/1/6,b/4/6,c/7/6,d/1/4,e/1/1,
   f/4/2.5,g/7/2.5,h/9/4}
   \node[vertex,fill=red!25]  (\name)  at (\xx,\yy) {\textcolor{blue}{\name}};
   \node[vertex,fill=green!25] (i) at (12,4) {i};
   \foreach \from / \to in {a/b,b/c,c/h,d/f,e/f,f/g,g/h,h/i}
   \path[arc] (\from) -- (\to); 
   \end{tikzpicture}

In an even more general situation, the same product or the same
intermediate product might be obtained following different production
paths, and a choice of the most convenient one needs to be
done. Moreover, each product, either final or intermediate, might need
a different quantity of parts from the upper production levels, like
we depict in the following figure:

.. tikz::

   \begin{tikzpicture}[auto,swap,scale=0.8]
   \foreach \name / \xx / \yy in {a/1/6,b/4/6,c/7/6,d/1/4,e/1/1,
   f/4/2.5,g/7/2.5,h/9/4}
   \node[vertex,red!25]  (\name)  at (\xx,\yy) {\textcolor{blue}{\name}};
   \node[vertex,green!25] (i) at (12,4) {\textcolor{blue}{i}};
   \foreach \from / \to / \lab in
   {a/b/1,b/c/3,c/h/2,d/f/3,e/f/1,f/g/1,g/h/2,h/i/2,d/b/2,f/c/4} 
   \path[arc] (\from) -- node[above] {\lab} (\to); 
   \end{tikzpicture}


In a complex situation like those described here we may assume that a
graph :math:`G=\langle V,E \rangle` is available to represent the
flow of material and of parts required for the assembly.
Let us denote with :math:`\mathpar{r}^{ij}` the number of products of type
:math:`i` required as input to product :math:`j`. Let
:math:`\mathpar{\gamma}^i`  the *lead time* for the production of one unit of
:math:`i`. This is considered as an integer number of time periods
between the start of production and the time by which the part becomes
available.

A possibility for the formulation of this model is the following:
  
.. math::
   :nowrap:
      
   \begin{align*}
   \min &\sum_{t=1}^T  \sum_{i=1}^m (\mathpar{p}^i_t \var{x}^i_t +
   \mathpar{q}^i_t \mathvar{y}\delta^i_t + \mathpar{h}^i_t  \var{s}^i_t)  \\
   \var{s}^i_{t-1} + \var{x}^i_{t - \mathpar{\gamma}^i}  & =
   \mathpar{d}^i_t +
   \sum_{j: (i,j) \in E} \mathpar{r}^{ij}
   \var{x}^j_t + \var{s}^i_t & \forall\, &i,t\\
   \var{x}^i_t & \leq  \mathpar{M}^i_t \mathvar{\delta}^i_t & \forall\, &i,t\\
   \sum_i \mathpar{\alpha}^{ik} \var{x}^i_t + \sum_i \mathpar{\beta}^{ik}
   \mathvar{\delta}^i_t & \leq \mathpar{L}^k_t 
   & \forall\,&t,k\\
   \var{x}, \var{s} & \geq 0\\
   \mathvar{\delta} & \in \{0,1\}^{mn} \\
   \end{align*}

This model, again, inherits many of the basic building blocks of
previously seen models, with some important variations.  In the first
set of equations, we can recognize the basic structure of balance
equations. However, in the left hand side, the set of "ready" products
of type :math:`i` can be seen to be composed either of items in the
inventory at the end of the previous time period, as usual, plus
the quantity of produced items which are available. However, in order
to take into account the lead time, i.e., the time between actual
production start and the availability of the product, the temporal
index is not the actual period, but is shifted backward
:math:`\mathpar{\gamma}_i` time units. This way we can take into
account the fact that production is not instantaneous, and, in
particular, production started in a period does not necessarily lead
to a finished product in the same period, ready to satisfy the demand.

On the right hand side, the output side, we have the demand, which is
the real, exogenous, demand for that product at that time period; as
usual, we have the final inventory too. However, now, there is another
important component of the flow out of period :math:`t`: this is
composed of all of the material, ready to ship in this period, which
is required as an input in later production stages. The term

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align*}
   \sum_{j: (i,j) \in E} \mathpar{r}^{ij}
   \var{x}^j_t 
   \end{align*}

corresponds to all of the internal requirement for this product. The
sum is extended to all production nodes in the MRP graph which require
parts of type :math:`i` for their assembly. The number of parts
required is :math:`\mathpar{r}^{ij}`. This way we model both the
satisfaction of external demand, as well as the demand which arises
from other production stages within the same plant. The main
difference between the two demand types is that while the external
demand may be assumed to be known, or at least, estimated, the
internal demand is part of the decision process itself, and is linked
with all of the other variables of the problem.

Of course, this is a basic building block; it might be generalized in
several ways, taking, e.g., into account some of the extensions we
have seen before.
We might have, e.g., some deadlines, which we might model through a
backlog,  and impose penalties for late delivery.
It is important to recall that solving problems like
this one, while computationally difficult, might be extremely
beneficial in terms of the solution quality.
